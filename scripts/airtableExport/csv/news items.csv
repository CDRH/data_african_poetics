Brutus was the centre of a diplomatic incident last September after he was shot down in a busy Johannesburg street by a police warrant officer as he made a dash for freedom. Brutus was banned and confined to the magisterial area of Johannesburg last year after his return from Europe where he had made representations about discrimination in Olympic teams. He broke his ban and went to Swaziland from where he intended to return to Europe to approach Olympic headquarters in Switzerland, but after crossing the border into Mozambique he was arrested by Portuguese secret police and returned to South Africa. Brutus said at the time and repeated in court today, while pleading in mitigation of sentence, that he had had a valid Rhodesian Federation passport. During the diplomatic row at that time Pretoria submitted that Brutus was a South African citizen. The magistrate ruled that Brutus's contention that his escape bid was made to draw attention to his situation was not altogether valid, but the court would take into account that he had been wounded, which was a partial penalty for his offence.

Thirteen countries have formally notified the International Committee of their withdrawal. They are Congo, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, Cameroon, Guyana, Niger, Togo, Uganda and Swaziland. Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Upper Volta have verbally informed the IOC that they will not be taking part, and news was received yesterday from Cairo that Egypt is also pulling out. Before the news was received of Mali's marching orders, 303 competitors and 60 officials were listed as leaving the Olympics. This still left 6,934 competitors and 2,825 officials from 100 countries taking part with, in most cases, undiminished enthusiasm. Two of the chief boycott organizers have already left the battlefield. Abraham Ordia, of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, has flown home to Nigeria, and Denis Brutus, president of the South African Non-racial Olympic Committee, has left the Queen Elizabeth hotel, where his bemused elderly victims in the IOC are also housed, to return to his university in Chicago.

Of Penguin's anthology, he writes, ""No work to date so completely misrepresents the full spectrum of poetry from this part of the world, and seems so perversely designed to mislead readers who do not already have extensive independent knowledge of local political and cultural history... Gray claims that all nations of southern African belong to a single 'literary system' whose importance overrides any division of the area into separate nation-states."" Of Watts, Watson has a more positive opinion, in that Watts instead makes the ""essential point"" that the work of black writers in South Africa is ""very different from that of African writers elsewhere."" He then writes that, ""having presented these differences, [Jane Watts] is able to explain with admirable lucidity why black writing in this country has progressively assumed an identity all its own, and most particularly why it no longer conforms to Western aesthetic standards.""","[The Penguin Book of Southern African Verse (1989)](apdp.work.000230)","","","[""review"", ""criticism"", ""indigenous"", ""identity"", ""aesthetic""]"," - ","","['recY1LosCMWsaMfT9', 'rec0hWBNJrSxkn0XU', 'recI14jF9KCNgsPTL', 'recnQXjZf9AtZ11ob', 'recmZ0Z89yjJubuVd', 'recOK9nqGIHL6B1qJ', 'recI49kpLGmVGI59r', 'receEE6aIdNWuwzCH', 'rec2rxIhLNXYF1lpR']","True","[Breytenbach, Breyten](apdp.person.001295)|Poet;;;[Campbell, Roy](apdp.person.000514)|Poet;;;[Livingstone, Douglas]()|Poet;;;[Cope, Robert Knox 'Jack'](apdp.person.000632)|Poet;;;[Horn, Peter Rudolf Gisela](apdp.person.001139)|Poet;;;[Plaatje, Solomon Tshekisho](apdp.person.000246)|Poet;;;[Mtshali, Oswald Mbuyiseni](apdp.person.001092)|Poet;;;[Watson, Stephen](apdp.person.001227)|Critic;;;[Watson, Stephen](apdp.person.001227)|Article Author;;;[Schreiner, Olive]()|Writer","[""Breytenbach, Breyten"", ""Campbell, Roy"", ""Cope, Robert Knox 'Jack'"", ""Horn, Peter Rudolf Gisela"", ""Plaatje, Solomon Tshekisho"", ""Mtshali, Oswald Mbuyiseni"", ""Watson, Stephen""]","[""Watson, Stephen""]","1990",""

B. Yeats and Ezra Pound was confined to the literary fringe of revoution, and only the poets of the Irish and Spanish Republics, Patrick Pearse, and Garcia Lorca, seem fit to be considered in the same breath as Goethe and Byron. Last week's Insight story on running illicit arms to Nigeria (""Gun-running via Birminham"") has, however, produced a contemporary contender for the role, a distinguished Nigerian poet, Christopher Okigbo. Okigbo, a member of the beleagured Ibo tribe from Eastern Nigeria, planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1,007 sub-machine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria. After a short stay in Geneva, where the negotiations with Favier took place, Okigbo flew to Rotterdam shortly before an ancient DC 4 took off on its ill-fated flight. Indeed, he was due to travel with the aircraft, but fortuitously changed his mind at the last moment. When the aircraft crashed in Cameroun just north of the Nigerian border two days later, a suitcase and some books belonging to Okigbo were found among the wreckage. CLASSICAL SCHOLAR. Born in 1932, Okigbo was educated at the Ibadan University where he was a classical scholar. After graduation, he became private secretary to the Nigerian Minister of Research and Information, but two years later he left to teach, and eventually represented the Cambridge University Press in West Africa. His poetry, as yet, shows no signs of political commitment. Although in one of his T. S. Eliot-inspired works the refrain reads: ""& the mortor is not yet dry...""; it refers, prosaically, to construction material not weapons of war. But Okigbo has during the last month gathered the raw material for what could, if he writes it, be the first epic poem about an illicit arms deal.""

Many of their authors will not have faced the question which their unique position asks them; of those that have, a surprising number will turn out to belong to that amazing generation of Nigerians--it includes Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, J. P. Clark, Christopher Okigbo--who made their debuts in the late Fifties and early Sixties. For these writers, examined in detail in Bruce King's Introduction to Nigerian Literature, a consciousness of their own cultural dilemma proved not an inhibition but a spur. Unlike Tutuola, whose imaginatively translated Yoruba foklore owes its richness as much to mistranslation of Yoruba as to a feeling for the adopted language itself, they are constantly aware of their responsibilites... Those who have picked the clearest path are without doubt the Ibo novelist Chinua Achebe and the Yoruba playwright Wole Soyinka. Soyinka is a poet, in love with words, images and myths, whose plays blend in a unique mixture all the rich formal elements of European drama with the haunting complexities of African ritual. The accomodation here between teh two cultures is complete. Gerald Moore's Wole Soyinka is a useful introduction for the student, but of course there is no substitute for reading or, if possible, seeing Soyinka's marvellous plays...""","","","","[""audience"", ""art"", ""sculpture"", ""language"", ""culture"", ""Yoruba"", ""folklore"", ""drama""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['reciyC8GIInu2PNsZ', 'recp1nQrGF2t2FVcK', 'rec7nHVQbDT6XKQF2', 'recVV3HuNvZVOJBwo', 'recfp55t9W6WJ8eBm', 'recUvp3AixDWz2HkM', 'recJ8n8v5kyrzRbW7', 'rec1aVXiu3G1Vvohm', 'recCqsQ3GVsiwhSFv', 'recftKxGM1BVC6Z1i', 'recGJNXDjCsusyRyN', 'recCmBvH4nlkxaHyP', 'recoV2mLZuWv4B5Ev', 'rec4WDiuQEc55ANrH']","True","[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.000265)|Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.001150)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.

When his words were clear, clarity was their most striking quality.

There are two spurs which are likely to gaod the non-European writer more and more in the direction of experiment in the coming years. First, the sense of alienation which is apt to pursue him everywhere once he becomes fully aware, in the search for an identity, of what he is not... Secondly, those who are attempting to record in English or in French the lives of people who do not spak them are immediately confronted with the absolute necessity to experiment with langauge. They may attempt to transfer the imagery, the speech-rhythms, or even, as Gabriel Okara of Nigeria has done in one interesting chapter, the actual syntax of vernacular speech.

The main accusation levelled here is that European critics have attempted to annex African literature for themselves. If a book is written in English or French then it is seen as a by-product or subdivision of the Great Tradition, of Modernism, or of some other beautified cultural monolith... They defend African orature against its alleged deficiencies in characterization and range of expression, and witheringly expose the pretensions of European critics who half get the point and so miss it by miles--in, for example, comparing the brevity of many African novels with oral tales... Toward the Decolonization of African Literature is not a pioneer study but it articulates a point of view which is increasingly heard among African critics and which has not previously been marshalled with so much damning quotation. It restores to literary criticism a brio, verging at times on insult, which is rare in Western criticism, where so often genteel irony or theoretical contortions are substituted for plain-spoken assertion of a fully held point of view.

The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which includes 36 countries in its membership has cabled the British Government stating that African countries will withdraw from the Edinburgh games in protest at what they regard as racism in cricket. Mr. Denis Brutus, the chairman of Sanroc, said in London last night: ""At a recent meeting of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which was held in Cairo our representatives had never seen such militancy expressed on the question of the visit of the South African cricketers. We in Sanroc are now proposing to cable all member countries of the Commonwealth Games Federation asking them to boycott the games. The latest development in the controversy over the cricket tour indicates to us that many very prominent people in Britain are giving their support to the M.C.C. We feel so strongly about this blatant racism that we regretfully have to fight back,"" he said. The chairman of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa is Mr. Abraham Ordia, a member of the Nigerian National Olympic Committee and the secretary is Mr. Jean-Claude Ganga from Brazzaville. It was, at first, the Kenyan Minister for Sport who suggested that no sportsman from his country would run in Edinburgh against anyone who had competed in the all-white South African games last year. He has been given the full support of black Africa and it is felt that Asian and West Indian members of the Commonwealth will soon follow suit. Mr. Brutus said: ""I hope that even at this late date it is not too late for a change of mind in Britain. But the most recent developments suggest the South Africans will still play here with far-reaching effects upon international sport.""

Now I sat down among the other users of the library... My book was Jacobsen's Index of Objectionable Literature, a publication launched a few years ago by an enterprising man who realized that there was money to be made by collating and publishing in book-form the weekly list of South African censors' bannings... Most titles my finger was running down, page after page, were banned by the old Publications Control board, before April. They constitute virtually the entire oeuvre of black South African fiction writers, essayists and some poets, including Lewis Nkosi, Ezekiel Mphahlele, and Denis Brutus, and such individual works by myself, Dan Jacobson, Jack Cope, Mary Benson, C.

In some cases, exile has nurtured creativity, giving writers the political space to reveal the disparity between official rhetoric and reality. But to many it has not been kind... Okot P'Bitek, the Ugandan poet, is not the only one who, lacking a connection to the society he longed to write about, drank himself to death... In some instances, though, the elaborate repressive apparatus of the state has stimulated creativity by compelling writers to develop subtle and imaginative ways of bypassing censorship. Jack Mapanje, Malwai's best-known poet, who was released in May last year after three-and-a-half years' detention without charge or trial, believes that the draconian measures taken by the Malawi Censorship Board may have inadvertently caused him to write better poems.

LAST ""MINSTREL"" OF NORTH AFRICA
FROM OUR ALGIERS CORRESPONDENT

Just after noon on January 12, almost at the beginning of Ramadan the famous Moslem poet Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi, died at Mazuna.  He was over 80, and had been il for a long time. For may years he lived at Ain-Morane, where he was the central figure in a group of native chiefs, the descendants of those who had fought in the border battles btween Bu-Maaza, the Sultan of the Dahra and the Warsenis, and Saint-Arnaud and Pelissier. He was the living history of those stirring times.
Later on he came to Mazuna and became the proprietor of a Moorish cafe, which was opened by M.Jules Cambon, then Governor-General of Algeria, and was for many years a place  of pilgrimage for poets from all over North Africa. His chief delight was in long improvisations, for which he relied on his remarkable retentive memory. In his library were to be found nearly all the works of the North African Moslem poets especialy those of Morocco and Western Algeria, and he would readily recite long narrative poems of over 1,200 lines, such as the famous Moslem poems of the seventeenth century. He died poor, having spent nearly all his money in paying scribes to record the traditional Moslem poetry. Wirh him has passed probably the last of those who have long borne the banner of Moslem ministrelsy in North Africa.","","['rec5QTXygRJUaGBBm']","[Death of Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi](apdp.event.000074)","[""death"", ""muslim"", ""minstrel"", ""ramadan"", ""pilgrimage""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['reciZ9FOYexhqW60D']","True","[El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda](apdp.person.000213)|Poet","[""El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda""]","","1930",""

Laing handles surrealism well, and is capable of excellent passages."" Of The Fate of Vultures, Foden suggests that the anthology reflects the great depth of talent and vigour in modern African poetry.

Fifty-three Brigade, to which he had attached himself in a dramatic act of solidarity, was in full retreat, with the exception of Okigbo himself, who had decided to hold his ground in an ill-protected bunker.

It rages within the mind of the hero, sometimes paralysing his will to action, instead of being projected into a simple contest between generations or between city and village.

The issue is focused mainly on writing from eastern Africa, with contributions by Kenyans (Malusu Jose, Taban Lo Liyong, Stephen Ndichu, Barry Odour-Otieno, J. A. Opiche, Osotsi), Ugandans (Okot P'Bitek, Peter Nazareth), and a Somali (Abdi Sheik-Abdi). There are also items from other parts of the world, including poems by Andrew Salkey, and an instalment of Ezekiel Mphahlele's ""Notes from the Black American World"", entitled ""Images of Africa in Afro-American Literature"".

Today, the most outstanding leaders are emerging not from the ranks of the ruling class, but from among ordinary people who have despaired of the government and have decided to create their own path... And yet the irony is that democracy will ultimately work in favour of the ordinary Nigerian and against the politicians who pretend to be true democrats. The genius of democracy is that it is a self-perfecting system. The laws the politicians are now enacting as if in jest, under the assumption that they apply only to the common man and not to them, these same laws are what would work against them the day one good leader decides to enforce them.

Significantly, not one griot or towncrier from the oral tradition had been invited; not one representative of African literatures in African langauges participated. Many participants criticized the Eurocentrism of the Nobel theme. While Gabriel Okara (a Nigerian novelist and poet of the generation which began to publish at the time of independence in the early 1960s) saw the Nobel award as a 'recognition of African literature in the global context'. Zulu Sofola, a Nigerian playwright of the next generation, viewed it with reservations: 'If the award was given to Soyinka as a ticket to enable us to enter into the club of Western writers, then it is not useful to us.' A third interpretation was offered by William Conton, a novelist from Sierra Leone, who thought of it as 'a recognition of an African writer, who writes according to the concept of literary excellence of a group of Europeans.' In his address to the Conference, the Nigerian president, Ibrahim Babangida, stressed the need to preserve African literature in native language as the use of foreign languages tends, he said, to obscure the character of these works. G. G. Darah of Nigeria, citing the example of his researches into the oral literature of the Urhobo, declared that the corpus of the African spoken tradition is vaster than that of Europhone literature, and that its preoccupations are more relevant to the majority of Africans today; the Nigerian poet and polemicist, Chinweizu, argued that the Nobel was irrelevant to African culture: Europhone African literature--barely a century old--should take second place to Afrophone African literature, which is at least 5,000 years old. Eurocentrics attempted to curb the tide of Afrocentrism with vague pleas for cultural 'universalism'; or with claims that a return of the sources of African civilization would be 'naive romanticism' but at the end of the five-day conerence it was clear that the indigenous agenda had won. A resolution honouring Cheikh Anta Diop, whose studies in Egyptology recovered for African heritage the achievements of the Egypt of the pharoahs, was moved from the floor and added to the official communique.""","","","","[""literature"", ""afrophone"", ""criticism"", ""language"", ""native"", ""indigenous"", ""foreign"", ""oral"", ""orature"", ""griot"", ""towncrier"", ""tradition""]"," - ","","['recStcR6ZHRKibLoC', 'recWyuUcSfsHo5SLx', 'recR9mJyrrPTX8aYh', 'reciDPicErQfAqmIH', 'recDSoYkvP2wmlnZA', 'rec9dUElrUn0nd0tC', 'recpyGfdYTZ0ZdHOI', 'rec579GvsOmBCzUUb']","True","[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.000399)|Poet;;;[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Ibekwe, Chinweizu](apdp.person.000218)|Poet;;;[Sofala, Zulu]()|Writer;;;[Babangida, Ibrahim]()|Politician;;;[Darah, G.

The first successor to Lawino, Okot's Song of Ocol, was a disappointment, for it savoured too much of a conscientious attempt to give a voice to an essentially dull, pompous, and vindictive husband. But it was interesting to trace Okot's influence in the work of another Acoli writer, Okello Oculi, whose Orphan offered some passages of real bitterness and power...The impact of the second song is weakened by a slight sentimentalizing of the all-knowing, all-suffering harlot; yet here too Okot uses his new poetic language to induce the reader's sympathy to flow into strange places and to illuminate the corners of hidden lives.

Still, this year's Book Fair ('Celebrating African Books') left one extraordinary mark on the continent itself, as well as on the international literary world. Few major writers made it to the fair, though many were asked.

Sir--You published a report in the Diary some time ago (May 16) that I had received a letter from Wole Soyinka. This letter contained one very disturbing paragraph which at the specific request of the Nigerians who had sent the letter on to me I could not immediately make public. Now I can. This paragraph reads: ""Physically not as good as may be expected. Serious eye complaint, no treatment. More than a year asking for treatment--ignored."" Last year in a letter dated August 23 Chief Awolowo wrote to me ""With reference to your letter dated July 11, 1968, I am reliably informed that Mr. Wole Soyika is alive and in good health."" It must be obvious that if Wole's letter to me was accurate then Chief Awolowo was seriously misinformed. In the gaols of the world many political prisoners languish, some in appalling conditions denied all contact with the outsside world, others tortured, humiliated, and forgotten. Protests from outside sometimes make these conditions harsher and it is often difficult to know when to speak and when to keep silent. To plead for compassion and understanding, to ask that the political prisoners in Nigeria should be treated with humanity, is not to take sides in the horrible conflict that is tearing the country apart. A country is judged ultimately by the humanity that it shows in such instances and in its adherence to civilized standards. I am not interested nor are others in getting special treatment for Wole Soyinka. We are interested in trying to ensure that he and others like him should be treated with compassion....","","['rec6EUGd5CWwAC6WP']","[Arrest of Wole Soyinka in August 1967](apdp.event.000044)","[""illness"", ""arrest"", ""solitary"", ""imprisonment"", ""jail""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recfvBuD9wbnVaie3', 'recS7idXJ1qAm5u18', 'reccP6kF0r6tAxDtR']","True","[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Collings, Rex]()|Reporter;;;[Awolowo, Obafemi]()|Politician","[""Soyinka, Wole""]","","1960",""

Even works which seem to honour African history with some straightforwardness, like Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958), have hinted at interior weaknesses in the local personality which have been forewarnings of dissensions to come in the heyday of colonialism and of corruptions after independence... Ten years ago people argued whether Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter could be considered an African novel. Now they battle over the aesthetic criteria for evaluating literature which does not need to look to Europe for its legitimacy.

His poetry began to appear in 1905 and a selected edition with biographical introduction by Sir Robert Ensor was published by the Oxford University Press in 1947. Some of the poems in the book were obviously derivative, but others had force and originality from their blend of romantic, stoic, and satiric strains. He was deeply moved by the great themes of nature, character, and race in his native country. His Collected Poems was published last year.

The enterprise is undoubtedly worth while: our world is certainly not politically a single world, but culturally it is becoming at least potentially so. In literature, as in music and the visual arts, we feel a need to have some knowledge by report of what we may never know by acquaintance... In the African section of the fourth volume, the late Christopher Okigbo is credited with being 'one of the most exciting poets now writing in Africa,' and some critics might feel that the formative Western influence was Pound rather than Eliot. The poet from Gambia described as 'Leurie Peters' should surely be Lenrie Peters. It is pleasant to find that very fine bilingual writer in Afrikaans and English, Uys Krige, dealt with briefly,  but with proper respect, as is the highly civilized and persecuted South African poet, Dennis Brutus. The note on the Nigerian dramatist Wole Soyinka mentions that his most famous play, The Lion and the Jewel, 'presents the impositions of modern civilization as a threat to the African villagers' individuality.' ...""

Cook's collection has an even closer university connexion, being derived from Penpoint, which was founded in 1958-59, the magazine of the English Department of Makerere University College in Kampala, the capital of Uganda...The Black Orpheus collection represents the second generation. In West Africa the use of English is long domesticated and now comes the urge to play with it.

Ama Ata Aidoo is one of Africa's best-known women writers and was for several years Ghana's minister for education. This short novel, subtitled A Love Story, follows the fortunes of Esi, a young woman recently separated from her husband, trying to build a new life in which she can combine a relationship with a career, and retain her identity. But in Accra in 1990, women's roles are slow to change and the changes are meeting a lot of opposition. Esi's search for happiness is sympathetically told and offers Western readers a rare glimpse into the lives of contemporary Ghanaian women. Unfortunately, the arguments put forward, although valid, are so well known that they fail to have much impact (The Women's Press 6.99).""","[Changes: A Love Story (1991)](apdp.work.000123)","","","[""publication"", ""review"", ""novel""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['reciivi1XqO75Ci2K']","True","[Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'](apdp.person.000708)|Writer","[""Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'""]","","1990",""

Pringle was the son of a Scotch Border farmer, roughly contemporary with Keats. He acquired a good literary position in Edingurgh and made the friendship of Scott. But literature did not pay, and in 1819 he went out to South African with a Scotch party.

He was arrested after being interrogated by the federal police. Doctors, including Soyinka's personal physician, are quoted as reporting that he was not manhandled by the Nigerian police, as alleged by some foreign newspapers. His wife was allowed to visit him last Friday. News of other writers in the former Eastern Nigeria is obscure, although it is known that the poet Christopher Okigbo, the representative of Cambridge University Press here, was killed in action as an army major. Mr. Soyinka was reported in The Times last week to have been released by the federal authorities after his detention on August 17. Reports reaching London said that he was seriously ill. His arrest on that occasion followed the publication in Nigeria of a letter in which he urged the federal Government to call a truce on hostilities with the secessionist Eastern Region. Mr. Soyinka, who was educated at Leeds University, is the best-known poet, playwright, and novelist in Nigeria. Among his plays performed in Britain are, The Road, The Trials of Brother Jero, and The Lion and the Jewel.","","['rec6EUGd5CWwAC6WP']","[Arrest of Wole Soyinka in August 1967](apdp.event.000044)","[""playwright"", ""university"", ""drama"", ""professor"", ""government"", ""detained"", ""arrest"", ""interrogation"", ""imprisonment"", ""release"", ""secession""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recwmjUoTwttFRyVL', 'rec8FZO2sjtjkJ9N0']","True","[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.001150)|Mentioned Poet","[""Soyinka, Wole"", ""Okigbo, Christopher""]","","1960",""

Mason writes, ""From Senegal's indpendence, in 1960, until 1980 when he relinquished the Presidency of his nation, Leopold Sedar Senghor dominated the West African political and cultural scene as Maecenas, political philosopher and literary theorist and, not least, as a practising poet. Since his elevation in retirement to the Academie Francaise in 1983 and his move to Paris, the turmoil of his continent's political fortunes have so dimmed this renown that reappraisals of his writing now seem overdue. Melvin Dixon's English rendition of the definitive body of his poetry will, it is to be hoped, encourage this process."" Mason traces the history of the negritude movement and Senghor's involvement. She also criticizes some of the translation by Melvin Dixon, but ultimately praises the collection: ""Thus, while inadvertent infelicities occasionally muffle the poetry's African voice, nevertheless Melvin Dixon achieves that rarest of feats in the translation of poetry: he recreates Leopold Senghor in our own tongue, exhibiting with unflagging good faith his universality as a poet of love, of nature, of war and, rarest of modern accomplishments, of praise.","[The Collected Poetry (1998)](apdp.work.000067)","","","[""president"", ""negritude"", ""collection"", ""review"", ""language"", ""identity""]"," - ","","['recQPBNz0amPgy1kM', 'recjcuVyJVrX1OzzG', 'rec4ykFbnI5fAtckl', 'recj5qwi9z58xQHKR', 'recHY5FVSdbMMYw1l', 'recUscQLZHrAIlccB', 'recgFEuUN5JaFRFtp', 'recgPUUzywCrX9stB', 'reczGEMJJpurHUsEe']","True","[Senghor, Léopold Sédar](apdp.person.001141)|Poet;;;[Whitman, Walt]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Césaire, Aimé]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Mackay, Claude]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Maran, René]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Diop, Alioune]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Mason, Sheila]()|Critic;;;[Mason, Sheila]()|Article Author;;;[Dixon, Melvin]()|Academic;;;[Pompidou, Georges]()|Politician","[""Senghor, L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar""]","[""Mason, Sheila""]","2000",""

Wole Soyinka is known in Nigeria and in Britain not only as a dramatic writer, but also as an actor and producer. His earlier play, The Road, a highlight of the Commonwealth Arts Festival last year, recently won the Drama Prize at the Negro Arts Festival in Dakar. The Trials of Brother Jero is a satirical comedy, featuring a cunning prophet (played by Zaikes Mokae), whose brand of Christianity works to his own advantage. The Strong Breed is about a savage New Year ritual and the search for a scapegoat.

And its application enables the critic to proceed to the level of insight which relates the different uses of, for example, traditional Malagasy folk poetry - the so-called hain-teny or proverb formula - by the poets concerned, to their respective personal and class positions: Rabearivelo, the 'deracinated' intellectual whose reworking of the hain-teny conceits read like translation; and Ranaivo, the rediscoverer of his own culture who integrates the hain-teny into his work, thus bringing together 'task' and 'mask'.""

It was the first in the African Writers Series, the Heinemann Educational Books project that revolutionized the field of of anglophone African writing by providing literature for African readers by African writers....

They were concerned mostly with one or other of the many external examinations of London University or the City and Guilds... When I was a boy things were rather different. Books were rare indeed. I remember the very strong impression made on me by the rows and rows of books in my school library when I first got there in 1944. I was, of course, most fortunate in gaining admission to a government college, one of those rare schools which the colonial administration built and endowed lavishly, for obscure reasons of its own. Cricket was played zealously and, in one of them at least, Eton Fives. But their most valuable asset was books. It is no doubt significant that, besides myself, almost all of the first generation of Nigerian writers had gone to one of the four or five government colleges; T. M.

Extensive quotations from the plays, clearly related to context, and the attractive format of the book, make it a pleasure to read... This quality is unfortunately lacking in Anthony Graham-White's 'The Drama of Black Africa.' ... One important point that all three books tend to obscure (for instance, through book lists giving dates of publication rather than composition) is that the flow of dramatic writings of high literary quality in English has dried to a trickle in the past decade. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly political disillusionment, the ebbing of the powerful romantic and idealistic forces that produced an astonishing flood of creativity in the period just before and just after independence...""","[African Theatre Today (1976)](apdp.work.000027);;;[The Drama of Black Africa (1974)](apdp.work.000026);;;[African Literature Today (1968)](apdp.work.000025)","","","[""independence"", ""review"", ""play"", ""playwright"", ""theater"", ""theatre"", ""drama""]"," - ","","['rec17jWReGEC7MnkM', 'recos3ZmNvlbDWbjG', 'recxZTFCny7nAfe6r', 'rec4WHfIpDxzvRSOG', 'rec9zbJA43wxZkq2L', 'recI05miplIUvZJJg', 'recxd8j8Yx1nTG8nP', 'rechf2zbruJDCCzoj', 'recbHl9YYiMQETsG0', 'rect6aGxLczMBP3Eu', 'recxADUcxuYPHRhsB', 'recgqyodbIvSoNuW2', 'recbukfl5x64TOSus', 'reclKbaXr7OJj3JTO', 'recMBHJ4LyNltfcOJ']","True","[Axworthy, Geoffrey]()|Critic;;;[Axworthy, Geoffrey]()|Article Author;;;[Banham, Martin]()|Editor;;;[Jones, Eldred Durosimi]()|Editor;;;[Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'](apdp.person.000708)|Poet;;;[Ogunde, Hubert]()|Actor;;;[Ladipo, Duro]()|Artist;;;[Ogunmola, Kola]()|Actor;;;[de Graft, Joseph Coleman 'J.

Its American editor-in-chief, Mrs. Rosalie Murphy, says she ran into many problems. In Nigeria, the questionnaire sent to Wole Soyinka was not passed on to him in prison, where he has been for two years; while the entry on Christopher Okigbo had to be dropped after Mrs. Murphy had confirmed a report that he had been killed in the civil war. Then there were many black South African poets who have escaped from or otherwise left the country and still move from place to place: Bloke Modisane, believed to have left South Africa on foot in 1950, was traced to London. Minor racial complications occurred in this country, too. Most poets from Wales put down ""Welsh"" as their nationality, although some admitted to ""Anglo-Welsh.""

Any reader turning first to Eustace Palmer, as being the African in this brace of critics, is likely to be disappointed in his search for special illumination.... The collection of recorded interviews with various authors assembled in African Writers Talking derives its value from the fact that most of the writers have been interviewed several times, over a period of some years, and by different interlocutors. The result is a considerable illumination of the developing consciouness in men like Achebe, Okigbo, Awoonor, Ngugi, and Soyinka; consciousness about their own work, the nature of the art in which they work, and the degree of their obligation to be quite consciously teachers, stimulators and even admonishers of their societies....""

Mr. Okot's poem was originally composed in Lwo, the language of the Acoli people. Much of its imagery is rooted in their traditional songs of love, war, victory, and death. In rewriting his poem in English he has chosen a strong, simple idiom which preserves the sharpness and frankness of this imagery, a structure of short, free verses which flow swiftly and easily, and an uncondescending offer of all that is local and specific in the original... Inevitably lost is the pattern of rhyme, assonance and tonal variation offered by the vernacular. In the poet's own words, he has 'clipped a bit of the eagle's wings'.

Mostly this is attributed to the fact that the French built far fewer schools than the British, but provided a thorough secondary education. At the same time it was their avowed policy to assimilate Africans to French culture. Since they claimed that West Africa was not really a colony but ""France Outre-Mer"", Africans were considered as underprivileged only as long as they did not have a French education... On the other hand Nigeria made a very late start. There was nothing at all before Mr. Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard, which was published in 1952. Even then it took years before literature in Nigeria got off the ground. But the past few years have seen a literary activity here that equals anything in French West Africa. There are at least four novelists of interest: Achebe, Ekwensi, Nzekwu and Babatunde Jones (the last unpublished); there are lively poets: Okara, Soyinka, Clark and Okigbo--the first two represented on the previous page. There are the playwrights: Soyinka, Clark, Yetunde Esan. The place is full of literary criticism and controversy; there are literary journals, clubs and associations."" ...","","","","[""literature"", ""territory"", ""racism"", ""pidgin"", ""language"", ""assimilation"", ""criticism"", ""review""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recqjcBKmDpxS5Odo', 'recRSrVDTEwaeDOqq', 'rec4I5JGhh2fr9Qxg', 'recKKD8S5hkyynkLz', 'recU62rHmV0b6Ue8q', 'recdIOABbMesTlStz', 'recbiaZ0y8IGuks7M', 'recrJXtdxx4LsKbgI', 'recwje3d2but5YzxJ', 'recHVfCy8QRY4vZRe', 'recYiON7LVVR22Not', 'rec3OuhQ1pqKbeDlc', 'recX83TGXwQZygceO', 'recIeeYnh83lUt1uV', 'recE5YkqDivU7OXtl', 'recA5BsoeP8l7ku8M', 'recMwuSTviYCFK5N5']","True","[Senghor, Léopold Sédar](apdp.person.001141)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.000265)|Poet;;;[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.000399)|Poet;;;[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.
