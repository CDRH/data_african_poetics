He observes with a bitter and sardonic eye the grimy beer halls, the crowded trains, the slum housing, and the harsh working conditions that make up the lot of black Africans in South Africa. His bitterness finds expression in brilliantly controlled lines etched with an acid irony. Mtshali’s poetry is remarkable for its evocative imagery, and his confident and unexpected similes have a rich emotional impact.","","True","['recjVU8fYwFuRjmxf', 'recNs2GyxwempfjiY']","['recETcngUZCEJMt1r', 'recsckjmK0pv5Q51Y']","['recM5YBAfAbq8zBWO', 'recrvoNFLOf3c0SDR', 'recAdn6wjLKokP0QW', 'recOSrY0ZH8aTumIy', 'recI4bJ94JkpwAtsy', 'recmmKfnwA54qt85M', 'reckD2AYGBYGBM8nH', 'recQvKDt6JKyI8XPz']","['recJLQuqsxKT6NjZY', 'recI49kpLGmVGI59r', 'recMPKMyeVVvIQQsj', 'recNjYpLWC6NiDAj1', 'reclkhKKqsho4An7b', 'recfPZLJQc3MZu7Hn', 'recdOwXZsFKfFfa8e', 'rec5WskIvBpjQpNKq', 'recUcppuEMSdG7wSt', 'recpMZuhSHv0SdQzu']","['Poet', 'Poet', 'Poet', 'Poet', 'Poet', 'Poet', 'Poet', 'Mentioned Poet', 'Mentioned Poet', 'Mentioned Poet']"

","Dennis Brutus  , born in Salisbury Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), was a poet and anti-apartheid activist most known for his vocal opposition to South Africa's inclusion in the Olympics. Brutus protested the unfair and racist policies of the South African government in refusing to allow nonwhite athletes to participate in international competitions and called for the global community to boycott South Africa's participation. Brutus co-founded the organization SANROC (South African Non-Racial Olympics Committee) in 1962. Brutus was ""banned"" from South Africa and imprisoned once in 1963; he was barred from publishing in South Africa and lived in exile until 1990.

","Eugene Marais was a South African poet, writer, and naturalist who, during the Boer War in 1899, joined a German expedition that sought to ship ammunition and medicines to the Boer Commandos. Following the war, Marais studied nature in the wilderness of Pretoria, cataloguing animals and writing in Afrikaans. He was considered the leader of the Second Afrikaans Language Movement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Marais","Marais' work as a naturalist, although by no means trivial (he was one of the first scientists to practice ethology and was repeatedly acknowledged as such by Robert Ardrey and others), gained less public attention and appreciation than his contributions as a literalist. He discovered the Waterburg Cycad which was named after him (Encephalartos eugene-maraisii). He is amongst the greatest of the Afrikaner poets and remains one of the most popular, although his output was not large. Opperman described him as the first professional Afrikaner poet; Marais believed that craft was as important as inspiration for poetry. Along with J.H.H. de Waal and G.S. Preller, he was a leading light in the Second Afrikaans (language) Movement in the period immediately after the Second Boer War, which ended in 1902.

He was first hired by the colonial government in 1944 to manage its press division, and quickly was promoted to editor in chief of the publication La Voix du Congolais. By 1960, Patrice Lumumba encouraged Bolamba to join his liberal party; Bolamba was appointed the Secretary of State for Information and Cultural Affairs to the independent Congolese government. Though not a prolific writer, Bolamba is considered an important French-language writer in Belgian Africa.

Though he spent some years in the 1930s living in France and Spain, he returned to South Africa in 1935 to become a reporter for the South African Rand Daily Mail. During World War II, he was a war correspondent with the South African Army and was captured, spending two years as a prisoner of war. Krige's talent with Romance languages meant he became the primary translator of Romance literature into Afrikaans, which had a great impact on modern South African writing.

He studied abroad in both England and the United States and returned to Ghana after receiving his PhD in 1972. Awoonor was briefly imprisoned without trial in 1975 by the military government in Ghana for supposed conspiracy to overthrow, but was released in 1976.

Cullinan, alongside Lionel Abrahams, founded ""The Bateleur Press"" in 1974 and later the literary journal ""The Bloody Hourse"" in 1980. Cullinan was a renown poet, winning awards such as the Slug Award, the Olive Schreiner Prize, three Pringle Awards, the Sanlam Literary Award and the Merit Award.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cullinan","With Lionel Abrahams, he founded the Bateleur Press in 1974, and the literary journal The Bloody Horse: Writings and the Arts in 1980. Through the journal (the title taken from a poem by Roy Campbell) Cullinan sought to re-establish the standing of poetry in South Africa. Influences included John Betjeman, W. B. Yeats, Eugenio Montale, Rimbaud, and Dante.

Cullinan maintained close contact with other poets writing in South Africa, notably Gus Ferguson. Before their deaths, he was a friend and fellow writer to Lionel Abrahams, Guy Butler, Douglas Livingstone and Stephen Watson.
