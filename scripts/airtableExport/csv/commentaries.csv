"recy0H6MnGNN8f9IO","A Critical Reading of John Willett’s “Literature as Symptom","A Critical Reading of John Willett’s “Literature as Symptom","<p>John Willett, journalist and assistant editor of the Times Literary Supplement (1960-67) in London, writes about the literature coming out of Africa, claiming that Africa is ""making history quicker than she is making literature, and in some ways it is an embarrassing experience."" The Times Literary Supplement was/is based in the U.K. and was well-known for its critique of writers internationally, claiming to ""scrutinize and dissect"" the writings of said international writers. Willett alludes to the idea that Africa was lacking literary activity, favoriting the white voices of European writers through his assertion that white writers were excluded from consideration at the conference, which was the ""Conference of African Writers of English Expression"" at Makerere College in 1962. The conference was attended by many prominent African writers, such as Christopher Okigbo, in which the topics of what constitutes African literature, are writings reflecting African experience, and whether African literature had been written in African languages were discussed and critiqued by writers including Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Christopher Okigbo, Ngugi wa Thiong'o who were famously in attendance.</p>

<p>The conference was met with a lot of controversy, as highlighted by Willett in his article, in which many African writers refused to acknowledge non-African languages as being African literature. For Willett, this is what constitutes his disapproval of African literature and African history, assuming that these African writers who wish to oppose the colonial rule that had governed their societies are not following the ""guidelines"" set out by European expectations of literature. Willett makes the case for this by suggesting that African writers should acknowledge white audiences in making their writings accessible, but he also hints that African writers should be thankful for the British publishing industry. Ezekiel Mphahlele, South African writer, artist, and activist who was also in attendance at the conference, had stated that ""a writer should not fear to do violence to standard English if he feels it cumbersome."" In response to this, Willett says, in reference to Mphahlele's question of who these African writers were writing for, an African audience or a ""world-wide one using English,"" </p>

<blockquote>""This question is largely of publishing facilities, and it is
 not irrelevant that of the twenty-seven books (by participants and others)
 listed in the bibliography at the end twenty were published by British firms.""</blockquote>

<p>Here, it is quite evident that Willett is willing to support the European standards of literature and language as contributions to African writing.</p>

<p>Willett seemingly refuses to acknowledge any non-English African literature, upholding the Western view on African literature as inferior and unsuccessful if it is inaccessible to the ""world-wide"" audience using English. For Willett, a dichotomy is being placed in regards to African literature; it is either favoring the Western aesthetics or to be judged and deemed in the state of infancy when it comes to African literature. When Willett touches on Christopher Okigbo, he does so in the words of Ulli Beier, German editor, writer and scholar, where Willet praises Beier's critique of the field of African literature (specifically Nigerian literature). He says that Beier had confined himself to the works of Christopher Okigbo, J.P. Clark, and Dennis Brutus, but then suggest that Beier ""had not seen more than six or seven poems by such other promising writers as Wole Soyinka and Gabriel Okara,"" in which it is unknown if Beier had actually made this statement or not. In many ways, Willett is pushing for Beier to disregard emerging African writers, distinguishing them as incapable of producing extraordinary work to catch the Western eye as other writers may have already done. Willett says, ""We are certainly far from being able to speak of African literature as a whole,"" which is far from what the conference entailed. The conference had consisted of many African men and women who were bound to create ""within the next decade a corpus of writing which is today seriously read and critically valued in many parts of the world,"" as stated by Chinua Achebe in James Currey's <em>Leeds African Studies Bulletin</em>. <p>

<p>Achebe's prediction and aspirations for African literature proved accurate while Willett's pessimism of the field unfounded, since within the decade came an outpour of African literature, which included the emergence of African writers such as Dennis Brutus, Kofi Awoonor, Okot B'tek, Buchi Emecheta, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, and Mongo Beti, among many others. There was also the Heinemann Book Series, which sought to ensure a voice to major African writers such as Chinua Achebe, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Steve Biko, Ama Ata Aidoo, as well as other prominent African writers. Within the decade, the Heinemann Book Series had published over 120 works by African writers alone. <p>

<p>When it comes to Christopher Okigbo's work in regards to Willet's claims that African literature is far away from being discussed, it can be concluded that Willet had not given a nod to Okigbo's poetry and protest, his writings on African culture and sympathy for the political aspirations of the African writers emerging in and out of independence. He had made the declared assumption that African literature was at a crossroads; either immersing itself in European aesthetics or failing to achieve literary excellence out of the country as a whole. He calls the efforts of the conference that many of these phenomenal and legendary writers had attended as ""very scattered,"" which fails to recognize that the conference was not concerned with favoring European standards and expectations. Okigbo was a published author of three volumes of poetry, even as his life was cut short after dying in the Biafran war. He had written <em>Heavensgate</em> (1962), <em>Limits</em> (1964), and <em>Silences</em> (1965), and as stated by the Encyclopedia Britannica, had poems that appeared posthumously in 1971 ""under the title <em>Labyrinths, with Path of Thunder</em>."" To claim that this Nigerian poet, and many others, were scattered and incapable of being discussed, fails to recognize the African culture that Okigbo and his contemporaries alluded to in their works. Okigbo is one of the most anthologized African poets, was an editor of <em>Transition</em>, an African literary magazine, awarded for his works, and dedicated to establishing a publishing company in Enugu. <p>

<p>As Willett settles with the assumed lack of consideration for white audiences and writers, writers like Okigbo oppose Willet's assertions, giving voice to emerging writers their contemporaries for decades to come. There are no ""scattered patches of literary activity"" as Willett states; there is the opposition of colonial standards that African writers fought for (such as the conference), dismantling the cycle of oppression that had been placed upon them. <p>

"recLpGKc0Rce1XFv8","“A Critical Reading of Robert Fraser’s Comments on Christopher Okigbo in His TLS Article, “Far Remove”","“A Critical Reading of Robert Fraser’s Comments on Christopher Okigbo in His TLS Article, “Far Remove”","<p>Robert Fraser examines Christopher Okigbo's life through the eyes of those inspired by Okigbo's life and poetry before, during, and after the Biafran war, specifically Obi Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo, <em>Thirsting for Sunlight</em>, where we gain insight into Okigbo's place in a world that was predominately shaped by European standards and assertions of political turmoil and docility, in which Okigbo diverts our attention from, having the reader focus solely on his prophetic and lyrical journey of the African poetry coming out of, in this case, Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960 and before it as well. Not preoccupied with the pessimistic assumptions of the readers of his poetry in relation to the political nature surrounding his writing, Okigbo is more preoccupied with the spiritual pilgrimage through ""dislocation but travels through realization to a state of completion or recreation,"" (Nwosu 73), as mentioned in <em>Christopher Okigbo and the Postcolonial Market of Memories</em>. </p>
<p>Fraser accuses Africa as a continent ""eager for heroes,"" which ultimately brings in how African writers and readers are deemed eager for saviorism after their colonization, and/or during their colonization. Here, it is presumed that Fraser takes Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo as a lesson on the complexity of Okigbo's work, more pessimistic than optimistic as Okigbo or Nwakanma may have hoped for their readers. Fraser seems to indicate that Okigbo's contemporaries are playing catch up when it comes to creating work inspired by Okigbo's poetry, which is ultimately a narrative too often seen in Western media. While it may be difficult to draw the same tone and lyricism from Okigbo, to presume it as a ""rise to more bad imitations that any other poet"" is rooted in an oppressive cycle of cynicism and pessimism for future African poets from the Western scene. Okigbo was courageous, as Fraser mentions, but Fraser also mentions that the only constant that Okigbo had was his verse. This alludes to the idea that Okigbo was rebellious in nature, instable when it came to sticking to one place at one time, but Okigbo is seemingly aware that stability in nature is uncertainty in the journey of his poetic form and writing in general. What I mean here is that Fraser seems to be contradictory in portraying Okigbo for the writer of Igbo folklore, the classical and the natural, as mentioned in Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo. </p>
<p> From what is seen in his poetry, Okigbo does not romanticize the ideas of colonialism and politics of the upcoming Biafran war, but in this article, Fraser seems to be insinuating that Okigbo is driven by the ""political turmoil"" of Nigerian post-independence. Okigbo work is seemingly intertwined with reassertion of culture and resistance to the colonial atmosphere, as seen in his prophetic verse and lyrical form. We see this in Siren Limits(?), published in 1962 (?), in which Okigbo writes, </p>
<blockquote><p><em>""I have had my cleansing…<br/>
Emigrant with air-borne nose"" </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Okigbo does not give life to the colonial implications of British rule, but rather signifies the buoyance of hope and reemerged culture as he hints at in the verse above. He has ""had his cleansing"" of the European standards and assertions of submissiveness, but has regained hope in the face of constant movement. </p>
<p>Here we see lyrical intertwined with the spiritual, in which Okigbo gives us insight into the journey of memories of home and movement, seeking affection for the past. Combining what is presumed to be his Christian affiliation and the Igbo identity that he held dear, Okigbo grants us the reemergence of his homecoming to the post-colonial world. He writes in Distances (1964) (?):</p>
<blockquote><p><em> ""But what does my divine rejoicing hold? A bowl of incense, a nest of fireflies?<br/>
 I was the sole witness to my homecoming."" </em></p></blockquote>
  <p>We witness Okigbo's homecoming from that of the Western influence on African identities and writings, but Okigbo grants us a homecoming of culture and immersive lyricism and idiom, which Fraser seemingly fails to mention in this news article. Focused primarily on Okigbo's constant state of movement, Fraser takes Nwakanma's biography in contradictory stances, insisting that it is a hard project to take on but that the author is concerned with making Okigbo favored in the eyes of his subjects. Fraser does not mention Okigbo's poetry and resistance to the colonial narratives placed upon himself and his contemporaries but mentions Okigbo's ""faults"" and distancing of his mental place, insinuating them as inconsistencies rather than planned out experiences by Okigbo himself. A difficult approach to the article rests with Fraser's intentions on reviewing Obi Nwakanma's biography in light of Okigbo's work and influence in and out of Africa; is Fraser preoccupied with the life of Okigbo as a soldier, in which the life of Okigbo in relation to his military involvement is brought in appropriately, or is Fraser more preoccupied with the disagreement of Okigbo's choices as a poet? <p>

Soyinka had ten mentions in advertisements and announcements in the Times and the Times Literary Supplement between 1965 and 1983.</p>

<p>Even though Wole Soyinka had written four poetry collections by 1976, <em>Idanre and Other Poems</em> (1969), <em>A Big Airplane Crashed into the Earth</em> (original title Poems from Prison) (1969), <em>A Shuttle in the Crypt</em> (1972), <em>Ogun Abibiman</em> (1976), and was anthologized in collections like <em>Modern Poetry in Africa</em> (1963), he was advertised in The Times far more times as a playwright than a poet. In a 1972 advertisement of the book <em>Wole Soyinka</em> published in the new Modern African Writers, a book series under the stables of Evans UK, Soyinka is described as a, ""…remarkable Nigerian writer, best known as a major dramatist but also widely praised as a poet, novelist and commentator.""</p>

<p>Most of Soyinka's early poetry collections were published by the one-man publishing company  of Rex Collings Ltd. It is possible the publisher didn't have the resources to advertise in The  Times, or may have not seen the advantages of such advertisements, and this may be responsible for the collections' lack of exposure in The Times.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Modern Poetry in Africa</em> published by Penguin Books in 1963</li>
  <li><em>Idanre and Other Poems</em> published by Eyre Methuen and Company in 1969</li>
  <li><em>A Big Airplane Crashed into the Earth</em>, original title <em>Poems from Prison</em>, published by Rex Collings in 1969</li>
  <li><em>A Shuttle in the Crypt</em> published by Rex Collings/Eyre Methuen in 1972</li>
  <li><em>Ogun Abibiman</em> published by Rex Collings in 1976</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it should be noted the Rex Collins in his capacity as Wole Soyinka's publisher wrote an open letter in the ""Letters to the Editor"" page of The Times of Tuesday, June 10, 1969, asking that Soyinka who was then in prison in Nigeria for treason to be treated with compassion.</p>

<p>Book publishers and theatres advertised regularly in The Times and The Times Literary Supplement, and the consistent advertisement of the works of African writers and artists indicate the relevance of their works or that there was an audience and market for them. Soyinka's novel, <em>The Interpreters</em>, was included in the Times English Books of the 1960s. The Negro Theatre Workshop, still in the process of registering as a trust and non-profit, advertised a special charity review of Wole Soyinka's play, <em>The Road</em>.</p>

<p>The 1965 advertisement for three plays titled ""Season of African Plays"" announces Wole Soyinka, as a dramatic writer, actor, and producer known in Nigeria and Britain, whose play, <em>The Road</em>, was the highlight of the Commonwealth Arts festival of 1966. Unlike Soyinka, the writer of the third play, <em>The Knot</em>, the highly regarded white South African Playwright, Athol Fugard didn't get an introduction.</p>

<p>The 1966 advertisement titled ""Nigerian play for Court Theater"" touts Wole Soyinka's credentials—his degree from the University of Leeds and connection to the Royal Court Theatre group of writers—before the actual announcement of the play. The advert reads like his talents and credibility had to be marketed to this audience who, one may presume, would find great value in Soyinka's training in the west.  No mention is given of Soyinka's degree at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, a school he attended with his famous compatriots Christopher Okigbo and China Achebe. Nevertheless, the showing of the play in question, <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em>, was postponed because of a sick, unnamed director, this was announced in a subsequent advertisement. Soyinka's connection with the University of Leeds and the Royal Court Theatre no doubt gave him access to the British audience and by extension the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The only image in the ten announcements/advertisements of Soyinka's works is a black and white picture of what would later be synonymous with the Soyinka brand, his full afro. In 1972, Evans UK used this image twice to advertise its nonfiction titles in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>. Soyinka's works were included in both books, <em>Modern African Writers</em>, and <em>Introduction to Nigerian Literature</em>—a critical assessment of traditional drama, oral poetry, and printed literature in major Nigerian languages.</p>

<p>Heinemann in 1972, paid for an advertisement to commemorate the publication of its 100th paperback book in the ""world famous"" African Writers Series, <em>Girls at War</em> by Chinua Achebe. Wole Soyinka's book, <em>The Interpreters</em> is listed as the 76th book.</p>

<p>In 1978, Heinemann Educational Books, a division of Heinemann, advertised a wide array of books from all over the world. Soyinka gets a mention in the second edition of <em>The Literature and Thought of Modern Africa</em>.</p>

<p>The South African publisher David Philip had an interesting advert titled ""Publishers are Defined by Their Authors."" Why did this South African publisher decide on this title for its 1983 advert in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>? The publisher announced its stand against apartheid. David Philip was one of very few South African publishers that published black Africans and anti-apartheid activists during apartheid. It is no wonder that Soyinka, who was a strong critic of successive Nigerian military governments was included in the roll call of David Philip authors.</p>

<p>The announcements for Soyinka's plays were published in 1965-6 and book advertisements in the 1970s. An analysis of his work in announcements and advertisements shows that Soyinka's mentions shifted from plays to fiction, poetry, and critical essays, though the attention to his poetry was fairly scant. There was a lull, and the Nigerian Civil War may have been responsible for this, between 1967 and 1970. Soyinka was outspoken critic of the war and appealed to both sides—the Nigerian federal government and Biafra—for a ceasefire. For his activism, he was imprisoned without trial for treasonable acts for twenty-two months by the federal government.</p>

  <footer> (Dickinson, from <cite>Voice of the Poets</cite>) </footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The epigraph above reflects the common racist rhetoric found in British criticism of mid-20th century African writers. On September 13, 1965 <em>The Times Supplement On the Arts in the Commonwealth</em> posted an article by contributor Patrick Dickinson titled ""Voice of the Poets."" In it, Dickinson examines the poetry written by commonwealth poets in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Africa, especially their relationship with, and ability to wield, an English language that is representative of place. Of the antipodes he says, ""The problem of their poets has been and still is to write in a tongue which is their own, a rhythm of speech which reflects their own vernacular. But they do not want to be ""regional"""" (Dickinson). Unlike the Canadian poet, however, the African poet, Dickinson claims, is aware of other languages, very likely grew up speaking other languages, and therefore ""may still be writing in translation"" (Dickinson). He describes the African ""fascination"" with language as a detriment to creating a wholly African poetry removed from the shadow of the likes of Eliot. ""African poetry it seems to me must be (and is) fascinated by language. ""A primrose by the river's brim"" is part of the conventional imagery of exile to Antipodians or Canadians. To an African, reading Wordsworth must be a mystery"" (Dickinson).</p>

<p>Contemporary African writers such as Chimamanda Adichie and Nugugi Wa Thiongo among others have written about the ""foreignness"" of their English colonial education, specifically that the language of letters and learning, thus the language of social uplift, did not reflect their culture or communities. Never do they infer that this foreignness was based on a lack of understanding. On the contrary, the ""mystery"" of Wordsworth (if there was one) was about lack of representation, not an inability to decode the language of the colonizers. If they are mystified by anything, it's the culture of the colonizers, not the language they wield.</p>

<p>Dickinson uses ""foreignness"" as a way to explain this perceived African ""fascination"" with language. It is not an endearing fascination he speaks of, but a patronizing fascination that is rendered childlike in its awe of the toy hanging just out of reach. Not only does Dickinson's critique drip with condescension, but it is steeped in the false assumption that the African ""fascination"" with the English language is a barrier to writing evocatively and authentically about place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>African poets like Wole Soyinka or Christopher Okigbo are entrancing and entranced by language. Either they write of people or ideas. There is no yearn for the exposition of landscape to bolster nationality. Their aim is to write like... how would this sentence go on?...Like T.S. Eliot? He may well stand for this sort of expatriate poetry. Eliot changed his personal voice; his rhythms are neither Boston nor East Coker but rather from Atlantis. English African poetry has at the moment this quality of nowhere, of being translated from a language no one has ever conversed in.</p>
  <footer>(Dickinson)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentiment, while false, is also fundamentally xenophobic. To believe that understanding English literature is some kind of inherited, quasi-biological undertaking is a highly problematic assumption steeped in inherent racist ideology. In addition, Dickinson's definition of place is limited and based entirely on an English understanding of what constitutes landscape/culture and thus what could and should ""bolster nationality."" Dickinson is not the only one.</p>

<p>If we look at ""Eng. Lit. expands,"" a 1969 review by Norman Jeffares of <em>The Chosen Tongue: English Writing in the Tropical World </em>, an anthology edited by Gerald Moore, we see similar problematic rhetoric used to critique African writers. In this case Jeffares juxtaposes the African with the West Indian writer. While Jeffares doesn't go as far as Dickinson in claiming that African writers fail to yearn for an exposition of landscape and thus produce writing insulated from the discourse of nationalism, he does suggest that the African writer is too imaginatively-preoccupied with, and limited by, their country of origin. Of the West Indian writer, Jeffares says, ""The West Indian… speaks an international language, the unique language of the British West Indies dialect forms, a medley of structures and vocabulary derived from non-English sources"" (Jeffares).</p>

<p>His thoughts on the African writer are quite different— ""He finds more scope in living and working in his own country"" (Jeffares). While the West Indian writer calls forth the shores of Africa, the African writer, according to Jeffares, does not call forth the islands. Where the ""West Indian, makes his pilgrimage, searching for his ancestral memories, travelling to a distant town, and through time, through history, to a new knowledge of himself"" and back again, ""for the African, what is past or passing or to come makes up the contemporary community: and the modern African writer often reacts violently against it"" (Jeffares).</p>

<p>Jeffares does go on to list a handful of African writers that seem to make up an exception to his claim: Soyinka, Awoonor-Williams, Achebe, Okigbo and Clark. ""The richness, the range of choice, open to the West African writer, both in subject and style, is vast"" (Jeffares), but apparently this richness is only ""open"" to the African writer, not accessed or utilized by the majority of African writers of the time. This criticism feeds into the all too common, yet troubling narrative, that Africa, and it's cultural and artistic productions, is in a constant state of becoming, but never arriving, an adolescent that never reaches adulthood. This intentionally benevolent narrative has been all too successful in rendering Africa and its productions as in need of patronage, instead of a multitude of existing cultures with ""moral ideas and myths of enduring value"" (Dickinson) of their own.</p>

<p>However, this was not a sentiment unique to the 1960's. Almost fifteen years later, contributor M.M. Carlin reviews another anthology of African writing for <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> titled ""Understanding African Poetry: A Study of Ten Poets"" edited by Ken Goodwin. In ""Scorning the Sonnet"" Carlin echoes Dickinson's claim that the English language and the African writer do not mix. For Carlin, French is a more nuanced and eloquent language for the African writer. While English, with its heavy stresses and ""strong metrical beat, together with an easygoing critical attitude, have – at least to begin with – resulted in far too much African poetry whose flatness only serves to point up the ""influences"" – Hopkins, Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Dylan Thomas – the outcome of which is often mere pastiche"" (Carlin). According to Carlin, the durable African poems are the ones that are explicitly political by the likes of writers such as Okigbo, Soyinka, Okara, Owooner and few others. Like Jeffares, Carlin looks towards the future for the African writers who will one day wield an English representative of Africa and not it's canonical figures.</p>

<p>What these critiques make clear is that for the African writer in the 20th century to be well-received by the British literati was an acrobatic undertaking, a circus of mirrors. It required a multiplicity of allegiances and back bends that would exhaust the most dexterous of English language speakers. I'd guess that for the African writers of the time, what Carlin, Jeffares and Dickinson's racist gaze refused to see, was not only exhausting—it was deafening.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
M.M. Carlin was a British teacher of English Literature in Africa. The specific university and country is not readily available. He seems to have published mostly in the 1960's. The articles from this period (available online) were published by Indiana University Press. There is little information online about Carlin, but based on the subject matter of his articles, it's possible to assume he lived and taught in South Africa. Carlin's work focuses mostly on critiquing published articles by English men on the state of Africa and its cultural productions. Other works by Carlin include film reviews and a critique of an article about revolution and partition in South Africa published by the English South African journal, Encounter, of which he writes, ""There is a South Africa but she does not know herself"" and ""Perhaps the South African English, in their trance of dilemma, are the first actual South Africans?""</p>

Carlin’s Review of “Understanding African Poetry” by Ken Goodwin, Referencing Christopher Okigbo ","Commentary on Jeremy Brooks’ Review of “Survive the Peace” by Cyprian Ekwensi and M.M. Carlin’s Review of “Understanding African Poetry” by Ken Goodwin, Referencing Christopher Okigbo ","<p>In a 1976 review for <em>The Sunday Times</em> of the novel <em>Survive the Peace</em> by the Nigerian writer Cyprian Ekwensi, Jeremy Brooks begins by briefly referencing Nigerian poet Christopher Okigbo in order to enter a conversation about the state of African literature. Brooks immediately positions Okigbo, who he names as ""one of Nigeria's most distinguished poets,"" in opposition to ""his friend and fellow Ibo"" Chinua Achebe, quoting Okigbo as saying ""There is no African literature. There is good writing and bad writing—that is all."" Achebe, Brooks claims, ""leaned perhaps too far the other way,"" quoting Achebe as saying that ""an African creative writer who tries to avoid the big social and political issues of contemporary Africa will end up being completely irrelevant."" Brooks, it should be noted, was not primarily a scholar of African writing; a British novelist, playwright, and poet, Brooks was most famous for his 1960 novel <em>Jampot Smith</em>. This positioning of his is perhaps a half-formed and certainly a reductive one, and places both Okigbo's and Achebe's words without context or nuance, instead implying a binary in ideologies which ignores the larger complexities of the authors' positionalities. Although Brooks' review ultimately focuses on Ekwensi's novel, his mention of Okigbo—and the fact that he positions him ideologically against such a well-known novelist—is telling of both the gap in attention to African poetry at the time in this and other similar publications, as well as the collapsing of poetry as a genre into a larger umbrella of African literature. It's also illuminating in the way Brooks discusses that large category of African literature in relation to English writers.</p>

<p>After quoting Okigbo and Achebe and framing their viewpoints in opposition to one another, Brooks is insistent on positioning the work of African writers in relation to British writers, stating that post-colonial African writing ""has a driving urgency, a new minted freshness of expression which a British writer could no more ape than he can experience for himself the sense of direction and position that gives such authority to nineteenth century English fiction."" Brooks also claims that African literature ""is not to be defined by degrees of involvement in specifically African issues,"" suggesting that he's posing a middle ground between Okigbo and Achebe's stances, and yet his previous statement seems to contradict that claim. In describing African writing as something that no British writer could mimic, Brooks suggests that there is an innate quality to writing coming out of Africa—and belonging to <em>all</em> African writing, regardless of region, a claim that is problematic at best. His attempt to ""define"" African literature might stem from his attempts to understand or equate African writing in ways similar to how he understands British writing—which, considering the immense differences in scale of both place, people, and culture, is not a productive assessment.</p>

<p>This framing of African writing in relation to English writing is not singular to Brooks, by far. In another article published in 1976 in The Times Literary Supplement, M.M. Carlin reviews Ken Goodwin's <em>Understanding African Poetry: A Study of Ten Poets</em>. Carlin, who was a British teacher of English literature in Africa, worked primarily (in the articles available online) in critiquing articles by English men who were writing about Africa, mostly in the 1960's. In his review, Carlin points to Goodwin's way of placing the ten poets he discusses (including Okigbo) ""in the order of their Africanness, their independence of European models,"" which Carlin says ""forms a socio-cultural description of African poetry."" According to Carlin, Goodwin's distinction seems to favor the group of poets who he categorizes as writing most ""African"" (Gabriel Okara, Okot p'Bitek, and Mazisi Kunene). He writes that, in contrast, Dennis Brutus, Christopher Okigbo, Lenrie Peters, and John Pepper Clark all ""remained largely captive to the European, and particularly the British, tradition of poetry."" There seems to be an impulse here, on both Goodwin and Carlin's part, to separate English traditions—even the English language—from African writing, suggesting that the essence of African poetry is incompatible with English traditions and language, or that, at the very least, it's weakened by the attempt to harness forms such as the sonnet in finding their poetic voice. What this reading doesn't acknowledge or allow for, however, is the fact that writers like Okigbo, who have been trained in the British literary tradition, are also complicating that tradition and putting pressure on it. This also speaks especially to discussions in and around Wole Soyinka's <em>Myth Literature and the African World</em> (Cambridge, 1976), and especially Ngugi wa Thiong'o's <em>Decolonizing the Mind</em> (Heinemann, 1986), which speaks to complicated questions of language—and a writer's choice of language—in nations in which indigenous and colonial languages are used. </p>

"recHDGHYtBcAJV1EY","A Commentary on M.M Carlin’s 1983 Book Review of Ken Goodwin’s “Understanding African Poetry: A study of Ten Poets”with a Focus on Soyinka.","A Commentary on M.M Carlin’s 1983 Book Review of Ken Goodwin’s “Understanding African Poetry: A study of Ten Poets”with a Focus on Soyinka.","<p>Whether it is acknowledged or not, African writers, and indeed poets, live within the confluence of two or more traditions/languages, and their poetics emerge from the spaces where these worlds and languages collide. This is a commentary on the review of M.M Carlin, which interrogates Ken Goodwin's textual analysis and evaluation of ten African poets. Goodwin held the under-studied poets to account, through western standards and traditions of poetry.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, perhaps due to the lack of understanding of what African poetry is, most critical conversation fixates on thematic content and the socio-political context in which the poetry exists, and its criticism is restricted and viewed only through that limited lens. Consequently, its merits are assessed on its relative ""Africanness"", which is defined largely along the same socio-political lines mentioned above.</p>

<p>In Carlin's review published in the Times Literary Supplement of 16th September 1983, he explained that Goodwin's book categorized the poets ""roughly in the order of their Africanness, their dependence of European Models"" which aided the summing up of a group that included what was described as the ""Internationalists"" which are the poets who remained perpetual captives of the British  tradition of poetry (Dennis Brutus, Christopher Okigbo, Lenrie Peters and John Pepper Clark) and the second group which included poets like Taban, Awoonor and Soyinka, who synthesized indigenous African traditions and the European Traditions. And the last group who Goodwin claimed, ""were able to write as Africans with only minimal influence from Europe"".</p>

<p>A cursory look, at the Heinemann African writers' series which published poets like Christopher Okigbo, Gabriel Okara, Leopold Senghor, Tchicaya U'Tam'si among numerous others, makes the case that the series was already defining the African poetry ""canon"", which allowed for a more diverse representation of writing styles, influences and complexities of the broader African poetry landscape unlike Goodwin's categorization which defined African poetry from a reductionist perspective that paid no attention to the poetry that was emerging due to Africa's gruesome colonial history with Europe.</p>


<p>African poetry cannot be viewed ""independent of European model"" and certainly not dependent on a European model. To this point, this commentary will focus on the second group, specifically Wole Soyinka. Carlin's review expressed Eurocentric conceit, declaring that ""…historians may one day conclude that French was the best European language for African poetry."" Taking this expression at face value, the implication is that, even more than in African languages, African poetry flourishes most, in French. Perhaps Carlin's argument could be a comparison between French and English but that fails because why make such a comparison in the context of African poetry where both languages are not indigenous?</p>

<p>That declaration was made perhaps in a genuine fit of excitement that ""the distribution of stress in French, the flexibility of French meter offered Francophone poets in Africa the right combination of ease and authority [while] English on the other hand, demands of a heavily stressed language, with metrical beat, together with an easygoing critical attitude, have—at least to begin with— resulted in a far too much African poetry whose flatness only serves to point up the ""influences""—Hopkins, Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Dylan Thomas— the outcome of which is often mere pastiche"".</p>

<p>It is, however, a disingenuous assertion on the part of Carlin, who despite his declaration did not provide sufficient evidence to back it up, because there was only one francophone African poet, Lenrie Peters, in the list.</p>

<p>More so, that is a stunning surmising of what African poetry in English is, which is not only a great misreading but an acute imprudence that lies in the persistence of the patronizing colonial notion that all colonized people are seeking to enact the Caliban dynamic of attempting to ""master"" the language of the colonized. Reading influence in this limited political manner is both condescending and self-congratulatory, because African poets are contributing to the world of poetry, something that grows out of equally complex and profoundly sophisticated traditions that are not necessarily European.</p>

<p>Another implication of Carlin's assertion is that there were no original African poets, at least at that time, writing in English, which is self-contradictory of both himself and Goodwin's own categorization, which implied that poets like Soyinka wrote within the fringes and influences of both worlds, which at worst offers a hybridization that gives birth to a new language and perhaps tradition. Carlin's explanation that ""the most interesting and durable poems of the writers presented in <em>Understanding African Poetry</em> are in the broadly political- that is, they have something to say"" which infers that the African poet's politicization of poetry represents a dearth. He also stated that Goodwin's ""mild chidings [was] respectful and even reverential in tone"". This cynicism, however, suggests that the poetic value of the African poet is disconnected from poetics, and its strength is solely rooted in the subject. This does not consider that when a poem, for instance, captures the moment it yearns to represent, it causes an emotional reaction in its reader. Such a poem goes just beyond a reliance on subject for strength because it must have succeeded as a vehicle, found a language through which the subject could be experienced and understood. Goodwin stating that Afrikaans being a native European language points to a slight bias towards how African poetry is perceived under the scrutiny of western gaze. Afrikaans is perhaps a naturalized African language that evolved and developed out of a European language on the continent. Perhaps, historically, it cannot be considered indigenous to Africa like English and French, but still, hardly will both languages be considered as indigenous to Africa.</p>

<p>It is worthy to note that these African writers are writing fully aware of the European tradition, and wrestling with the indignity of having their own cultural and poetic traditions demeaned and degraded by European chauvinism.  So, the poets are being influenced by European traditions, which all would agree, moved them, challenged them and ""inspired"" them.  And inspiration may well be driven by the core impulse of the writer to find a voice ultimately truer to experience and culture through the powerful position of one feeling free to draw on any tradition presented to them out of a confidence in their grounding in language and place—in this case, wherever they are in Africa.  What these critics are doing is infantilizing African writers who are in fact approaching their work with the authority of feeling able to appropriate from the western tradition to suit their purpose, and to, in the process, critique that very tradition. These critics are only able to see imitation, and incapable of seeing the African poet as writing with authority.</p>

<p>M.M Carlin offered a contradiction that is not only interesting but should have been an opportunity for him to find better answers to his curiosity. Carlin stated that ""it would be impossible to find ten English poets of comparable age who had the same collective experiences of oppression, imprisonment, violence and war"" as the African poets. His posture admits that African poets possess a genuine experience that ""inspires far better poetry of their European counterparts"", but flatly panders to the expectation that African poets should uphold a British/Western tradition, in this instance the sonnet, or be judged by a tradition, as he puts, that does not inspire the kind of authentic language that lived experiences do.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Wole Soyinka is not just an English speaker but also a Yoruba speaker, who is rooted in its traditions and like other bilingual or multilingual speakers, and poets influenced by the languages they speak.</p>

<p>It is true that both Carlin and Goodwin are writing outside of the African poetry tradition and experiencing it through a bias that is detrimental to their understanding it and writing in their ignorance of the poetic culture which is where the misreading of both Carlin and Goodwin emerges from and the unwillingness to see through a different lens.</p>

<p>Though Carlin recognized and paid attention to the influence that experiences complicate, in the poetics of these poets, there is seemingly a lack of acknowledgement of how, Yoruba which is Soyinka's first language complicates his writing in English, and  amplifies everything from sentence construction to meter and ultimately rhythm, since his poetry exists in a reality that is an intersection of English and Yoruba.<p>

"recWKgWNR659EIyBD","Christopher Okigbo in Three British Newspaper Reports Between 1966 and 1993","Christopher Okigbo in Three British Newspaper Reports Between 1966 and 1993","<p>Christopher Okigbo was born in Ojoto, Nigeria in 1932 and studied Western classics at the University of Ibadan. He joined the Biafran side during the Nigerian Civil War and was killed in 1967 during an offensive by Nigerian forces against Nsukka. He published three poetry collections, <em>Heavensgate</em> (1962), <em>Limits</em> (1964), <em>Silences</em> (1965), and a posthumous collection in 1971 titled, <em>Labyrinths</em>.<p>

<p>The legacy of Okigbo the Poet-Soldier is chronicled in three news reports: ""A Poet in Arms (Guns, Sub-machine 9mm, 1007)"" an <em>Insight</em> story, ""Full Analysis of the War Awaited"" by Kaye Whiteman ""of West Africa,"" and ""The Arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa"" by A.M Daniels. Together, these three reports provide a view of Okigbo's pre-war political ideologies and legacy chronicled in western media. Even in literary discourses, Okigbo is often cited in connection to the circumstances of his death, this helped to create a myth around his poetry and legacy.</p>
<p>The first report, ""A Poet in Arms (Guns, Sub-machine 9mm, 1007)"" published in the ""Insight"" column of <em>The Sunday Times</em> of October 30, 1966 refers to Okigbo, W. B Yeats, Patrick Pearse, Garcia Lorca, Geothe, and Byron as ""…poets doubling as men of action.""</p>

<p> <em>The Sunday Times</em> was launched in 1822, it promised to uphold the freedom of the press against anyone who would stifle it. In 1963, it formed the Insight team, which became world famous for cutting-edge investigative journalism. The ""Insight"" team broke many of the key stories of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The ""Insight"" report describes an illicit arms deal in Birmingham, ""[Okigbo] planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1007 submachine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria."" Okigbo was said to have changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to board an ""ancient DC 4."" The plane crashed in Cameroon, and Okigbo's suitcase and books were found in its wreckage. </p>

<p>The ""Insight"" report carries an interesting comment, ""His poetry, as at yet, shows no signs of political commitment."" This comment is important because Okigbo was still alive when this was published. It may represent the beginning of the popularization of associating politics, protests, and wars with the poet. Indeed, the construction of romantic revolutionary heroic figures was not uncommon in that time.  The medical doctor and Cuban revolutionary, Che Guevara, stands out as the poster child of such figures, and Okigbo's identity was being constructed in the same mold.  The ""Insight"" quoting one of T. S Elliot's refrains ""&amp; the mortar is not yet dry…"" alludes to a future where Okigbo would write of his war experiences.</p>

<p>The second report ""Full Analysis of the War Awaited"" by Kaye Whiteman published in <em>The Financial Times</em> of March 6, 1972 is a complaint about the inability of Nigerian writers to write about the Nigerian Civil War. Whiteman attributes the unavailability of war stories to the survivors urge to bury the past in the postwar mood of reconciliation, and the discreet silence maintained by the main actors in the war who still hold valuable posts in government.</p>

<p>Martin Kaye Whiteman, journalist and editor, was born 9 March 1936 and died 17 May 2014. His obituary in <em>The Guardian</em> reads that, ""He met most of the key African leaders from the period of decolonisation and independence, both English- and French-speaking, and was in touch with many of those involved in public service throughout the continent. Whiteman also reported on the Nigerian civil war of 1967-70, witnessing the surrender of the Biafran general Philip Effiong to General Yakubu Gowon of the federal government."" Whiteman was the deputy editor, editor, editor-in-chief, and general manager of the weekly <em>West Africa</em> magazine. He was a contributing editor of <em>Africa Today<em> from 2002 onwards. His advocated for African journalism, the history of the continent and its preservation. He wrote a book, <em>Lagos: A Cultural and Historical Companion</em> (2012). </p>
<p>Whiteman doesn't show any concern for the lives lost during the war or the effect of the Nigerian Civil war on the country, rather he focuses on Nigeria being ""…an immensely rich field for any researcher interested in building a picture of what was…""  He specifies the type of researchers by casually adding that, ""…there are few if any outsiders who are able, willing or qualified to do this."" Whiteman declares the few available accounts of the war as unreliable and meaningless, but desires that the dairies kept by Nigerian soldiers during the war be published. He justifies his demand to know, by mentioning the need to archive history. </p>

<p>Some may argue that these war stories archived in history would be a testimonial of the experiences of victims, but this is not the case the Whiteman is making.  The stories he craves wouldn't be for the gain of the war victims, but an opportunity for outsiders to experience the war through the chronicled accounts of victims. </p>

<p>Whiteman drags Okigbo into this conversation, a sort of rude awakening of the dead to partake in a conversation he was not privy to. He recaps Okigbo's activities during the war in one sentence, ""Okigbo joined the Biafra war and was killed"" an allusion to the poet-soldier legacy. Okigbo's use in the report ends abruptly in that single line. Whiteman notes the impact of the war on creative writing by furthering the stance of the Insight team report, Okigbo's yet to be defined politics, ""…Nigeria's writers not initially very obviously politically committed, became caught up in the turbulence of event."" He ends the his report with the hope that the war stories would be written in the future, ""…if sensibilities were numbed, there is now, on the part of the defeated, at least a well of creative activity, much of it perhaps an attempt to record the passions before the memory passes."" </p>

<p>On July 2, 1993, twenty-six years after Okigbo's death another news report that makes a reference to him appears in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>, ""The arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa"" by A.M Daniels. </p>

<p>Anthony Malcolm Daniels was born in 1949 and known by the pen name Theodore Dalrymple. He is an English cultural critic, prison doctor and psychiatrist, who worked in some Sub-Saharan African countries. Daniels has written extensively on culture, art, politics, education, and medicine – drawing on his experiences as a doctor and psychiatrist in Africa and the United Kingdom. His most notable works are: <em>Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass</em> (2001), <em>Our Culture, What's Left of It</em> (2005), <em>Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality</em> (2010). </p>

<p>Daniels' report summarizes the events that led to the arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa who is from the Niger Delta specifically Ogoniland, part of the seceding side, Biafra, during the Nigeria Civil war. Okigbo is mentioned when the reporter points out a connection with Saro-Wiwa, both men attended the same secondary school, Government College Umuahia, though they were hardly contemporaries—Saro-Wiwa being almost ten years younger than Okigbo. </p>

<p>However, Daniels writes that is where the similarities between both men end. Saro-Wiwa opposed the Biafran secession, ""…he saw an Ibo state as a worse threat to the safety and wellbeing of ethnic minorities within it than in a federal Nigerian state."" </p>

<p>It seems that whenever there is an unrest or protest in Nigeria being campaigned for by a writer or a reference to the Biafra war made in the media, the poet-soldier, Christopher Okigbo must make an appearance to provide a comparison, historical connection, or credibility to the new activist. These news reports or articles, however, reveal shallow and reductionist portraits of Okigbo, without any in depth reference to his writing or even to his history. In this sense, Okigbo the poet-soldier is a convenient symbol, though what exactly he symbolizes is never extremely clear in these reports. </p>
