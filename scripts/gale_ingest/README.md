## Gale API Ingest 

In the "input" folder there is a csv with the URL's and Gale ID's of the original items. I believe all you need is the gale id, but I left the URL just in case. 

In the "example_csv" folder there is a csv that lists all the current data we have gathered. This should serve as a rough example for output format. 

Feel free to make any new folders/move things as needed in the "gale_ingest" folder, and you can add any documentation directly to this README or make new files as needed.
