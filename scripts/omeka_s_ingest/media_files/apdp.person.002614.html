She is the first Algerian woman to publish poetry and fiction in Arabic, and one of the most famous contemporary authors in the Arab world. Mosteghanemi has published two poetry collections, ala Marf' al-Ayyam (To the Days’ Haven) in 1973, and Al Kitaba fi Lahdat Ouray (The Writing in a Moment of Nudity) in 1976 with Dar Al-Adabin publishing in Beirut.
