<h3>Biography</h3>Donato Francisco Mattera was born in Westbury, Johannesburg in 1935. He grew up in the Johannesburg neighbourhood Sophiatown before the apartheid government moved his family to Westbury, an area segregated as coloured by the government. In his early years, he became involved in a gang, the Vultures, and was stabbed several times. He was once charged with murder but was eventually acquitted after awaiting trial for several months. It was after his release, during the campaign against the removals of Black, Coloured, and Indian people from Sophiatown, that Mattera became involved in politics, joining the African National Congress Youth League and becoming a political activist. He is the author of several books of memoir, poetry, and plays. He died in Soweto in 2022.
