<h3>Biography</h3>Kola Boof was born in 1969 in Omdurman, Sudan. After her adoption in 1979, she relocated to Washington, D.C where she was a Psychiatric Out-Patient until she was 17. Novelist and poet, she is the author of the poetry collection “Every Little Bit Hurts” (1995), which has been regarded as a provocative work of art for its political and sexual connotations. Her work is known to explore religion, the sexuality of African women, the treatment of women in Islamic countries, and Sudanese cultural history. Her essay “I Am My Own Daughter” won the Swedish Woman to Woman Literary Award in 2007. Over the years, there have been controversies surrounding her involvement in international politics and diplomatic relations, and Boof’s writings have served as ways of activism and a means to render her own account.
