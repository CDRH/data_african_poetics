<h3>Biography</h3>Khal Torabully was born in Mauritius in 1956. He attended Université Lumière Lyon 2 where he received a master's in comparative literature. He is most well known for his book “Cale d’etoiles: Coolitude” in which he coined the term “coolitude” derived from the word ‘coolie’ which was used derogatively to refer to indentured workers that were brought to islands to work following the abolition of the slave trade. In the book, he argued for the need for the descendants of the emancipated slaves and the indentured to relate together and to forge a cultural interplay. In 1993, he was awarded the Prix Jean Fanchette. He is also the author of twenty poetry collections, essays and articles, and several films.
