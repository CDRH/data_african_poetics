<h3>Biography</h3>Brian Ernest Walter was born in Port Elizabeth in 1956. He has taught at Chapman Senior Secondary School in Gelvandale, PE, and at the University of Fort Hare, Alice for nineteen years. He obtained a doctorate from Rhodes University, studying Sol Plaatjeâ€™s use of the romance mode to project a vision that could avert potential tragedy and using cross-cultural knowledge and sympathy to transform and translate tragic unkindness into a more human, moral understanding. He is the author of several literary and critical works, including: Tracks and Baakens, Mousebirds, and Groundwork: An Introduction to Reading and Writing about Poetry. He won the 1999 Thomas Pringle Award for poetry published in journals and the 2000 Ingrid Jonker Prize for his collection Tracks.
