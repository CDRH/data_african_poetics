<h3>Biography</h3>Phillip Zhuwao was born in 1971 in Harare, Zimbabwe. He was the son of a Mozambican mother and a Zambian father, born on a commercial farm into conditions of poverty. These origins were apparent in his writing, as he wrote in English but used neologisms, deliberate misspellings, and slang from rural communities. These varied registers and dialects make his work both fresh and unique. He died of an illness in 1994 at the tender age of 23. In the early 1990s, his poems were published in the South African journals Bliksem and New Coin. In 2004, a selection of his poems was collected and edited by Robert Berold and published by the South African publisher Deep South under the title Sunrise Poison. This edition contains the one surviving interview with Zhuwao.
