<h3>Biography</h3>Mourad Djebel was born in Annaba, Algeria in 1967. He studied town planning at the Mentouri University in Constantine, Algeria. Attracted to West Africa by the authors he admired, such as the Congolese author Tchicaya U'Tamsi, he travelled the continent, then, in 1994, settled in France. Although his work is written in French, he draws heavily from North African oral tradition which he incorporates by mixing universal heroes, moral themes, contemporary incursions, and mischievous humor. He is the author of several books such as Les Sens Prohibited and Les Contes des Trois Rives.
