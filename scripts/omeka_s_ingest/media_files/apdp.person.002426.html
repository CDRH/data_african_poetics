<h3>Biography</h3>Hassan Najmi was born in 1959 in Ben Ahmed, Morocco. He is the author of several poetry collections, including Lavendersâ€™ Princedom, Fallen Inadvertently, and Brown Winds, all of which are characterized by an interest in everyday life. Although his earlier poetry followed the traditions of Moroccan pioneer poets such as Ahmed Mejjati, Mohammed Serghini, and Abdelkarim Tabbal, he later departed from this style in favour of a more contemporary position. His poetry has been translated into English by Roger Allen, a renowned translator of modern Arabic fiction.
