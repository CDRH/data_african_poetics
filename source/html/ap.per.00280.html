<h2>Biography:</h2>

<p>Gabriel Okara, a prize-winning author whose literary career spans six decades, is rightly hailed as the elder statesman of Nigerian literature. The first Modernist poet of anglophone Africa, he is best known for <em>The Fisherman’s Invocation</em> (1978), <em>The Dreamer, His Vision</em> (2005), and for his early experimental novel, <em>The Voice</em> (1964).</p>

<p>Gabriel Okara was born at Bumoundi, Bayelsa State, in the Niger Delta in 1921 and educated at Government College Umuahia in Nigeria and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He worked as a bookbinder and printer for Federal Government Press at Lagos, served as the director of cultural and information services for the short-lived Republic of Biafra, and was the general manager of the Rivers State newspaper and broadcasting corporations. He was an honorary member of the Pan-African Writers’ Association, a fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters, and served as a writer in residence at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.</p>

<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3 id="adhiambo">Adhiambo</h3>
 
<p>I hear many voices<br/>
like it’s said a madman hears; <br/>
I hear trees talking <br/>
like it’s said a medicine man hears. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe I’m a madman <br/>
I’m a medicine man. <br/>
Maybe I’m mad, <br/>
for the voices are luring me, <br/>
urging me from the midnight  <br/>
moon and the silence of my desk <br/>
to walk on wave crests across a sea. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe I’m a medicine man <br/>
hearing talking saps, <br/>
seeing behind trees; <br/>
but who’s lost his powers of invocation. <br/>
 <br/>
But the voices and the trees  <br/>
are now a name-spelling and one figure  <br/>
silence-etched across <br/>
the moonfaced is walking, stepping <br/>
over continents and seas. <br/>
 <br/>
And I raised my hand — <br/>
my trembling hand, gripping <br/>
my heart as handkerchief  <br/>
and waved and waved and waved <br/>
but she turned her eyes away. </p>

<h3 id="happy_birthday_ada_our_ada">For Ada Udechukwu</h3>
 
 <p>Happy birthday, Ada, our Ada <br/>
I wish you many happy returns of good cuisine <br/>
Igbo cuisine, Ofe Onugbu, Kni aka.   <br/>
I knew my friend before you <br/>
In very trying times in other places, <br/>
He likes it hot, Ada, <br/>
Right from the pot, Ada, <br/>
So don’t you dare him <br/>
With something cold. <br/>  
He’ll explode to the sky. <br/>
You can’t then ask why <br/>
For you know he likes it hot, <br/>
Best of all <br/>
Let him take it direct from the pot <br/>
Then he’ll be content <br/>
By repeatedly saying <br/>
“what the madman said <br/>
what the madman said.”  </p>

<h3 id="you_laughed_and_laughed_and_laughed">You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed</h3>

<p>In your ears my song<br/>
is motor car misfiring<br/>
stropping with a choking cough:<br/>
and you laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
In your eyes my ante-<br/>
natal walk was inhuman, passing<br/>
your “omnivorous understanding” and you laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
You laughed at my song,<br/>
you laughed at my walk.<br/>
<br/>
Then I danced my magic dance<br/>
to the rhythm of talking drums pleading, but you shut your<br/>
eyes and laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
And then I opened my mystic<br/>
inside wide like<br/>
the sky, instead you entered your<br/>
car and laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
You laughed at my dance,<br/>
you laughed at my inside.<br/>
<br/>
You laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>
But your laughter was ice-block<br/>
laughter and it froze your inside froze<br/>
your voice froze your ears<br/>
froze your eyes and froze your tongue.<br/>
<br/>
And now it’s my turn to laugh;<br/>
but my laughter is not <br/>
ice-clock laughter. For I<br/>
know not cars, know not ice-blocks.<br/>
<br/>
My laughter is the fire<br/>
of the eye of the sky, the fire<br/>
of the earth, the fire of the air,<br/>
the fire of the seas and the <br/>
rivers fishes animals trees<br/>
and it thawed your inside,<br/>
thawed your voice, thawed your<br/>
ears, thawed your eyes and<br/>
thawed your tongue.<br/>
<br/>
So a meek wonder held<br/>
your shadow and you whispered:<br/>
“Why so?”<br/>
And I answered:<br/>
“Because my fathers and I<br/>
are owned by the living<br/>
warmed of the earth<br/>
through our naked feet.”</p>
