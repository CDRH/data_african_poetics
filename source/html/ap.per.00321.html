<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3 id="synesthesia">Synesthesia</h3>

<p>White is a color,<br/>
black is art. Nod to those before you.<br/>
Brown is a sense of being, and dark hovers<br/>
only beneath the shadows of necks—<br/>
those who fear it most. Here is to fear.<br/>
<br/>
Red are the tips of shoes of the woman<br/>
who waited in the bathroom patiently when I was<br/>
only three—to steal my mother’s ruby earrings. White<br/>
<br/>
is the unsafe silence of bathroom walls, and their<br/>
morbidly cubic nature. White is water running under<br/>
my feet, the innocent screams of schoolchildren<br/>
at lunch hour.<br/>
<br/>
Brown is the anomalous texture of curtains from my<br/>
childhood. Brown is also the parched wood<br/>
of a small coffee grinder my mother used. Brown as in<br/>
the intimate angles of sharply cut ambasha my grandmother<br/>
made, flour and water, lemon ski and cinnamon shreds, the<br/>
dark heads of raisins, while on a cargo plane back to Ethiopia,<br/>
the tired eyes of war victims and their slow recovery. Brown<br/>
is also the color of my skin, but I didn’t know it then. <br/>
<br/>
Blue are the waters embedded in my grandmother’s eyes. Blue is<br/>
the whisper of the Nile, Abbay. Blue is the color of the brave. Blue<br/>
are the walls of empty neighbors’ houses and the insides of their<br/>
living rooms. Blue is skimmed milk tearing the sky.<br/>
<br/>
White sometimes comes back at odd hours. White are stranger’s eyes<br/>
drenched in sadness. White is the uniform of doctors, the smell of<br/>
alcohol and something mad. White is absence. Purple comes back<br/>
<br/>
as shoes, American shoes. Sky and blood under a quiet shadow. The<br/>
shadow of a young tree planted in memory of a murdered teacher in<br/>
high school. And the milky paste of overripe figs spurting prematurely,<br/>
spiking insides. Purple is warmth in mid-July, when rain hails on corrugated<br/>
tin roofs and the leaning green arms of lonely corn plants.<br/>
<br/>
Yellow is crying: it’s a bell, a cathedral in Asmara? A school? Or the<br/>
shriek of a mass funeral. Yellow is dead. But listen to black. Listen to <br/>
black notes, black heart, listen. Black is art. Not of the artist, the art of<br/>
being. The painful art of memory. Here’s to remembering.  </p>

<h3 id="crossing_borders">Crossing Borders</h3>

<p>When we leave our homes,<br/>
someone has to set them on fire<br/>
though our eyes are trained to see this no longer. Instead, this house,<br/>
<br/>
we say, is filled with yellow daisies,<br/>
and its backyard houses the acacia tree<br/>
mother planted years ago.<br/>
<br/>
We are given new names, new<br/>
sounds for our sorrows. We are <br/>
told new stories that somehow <br/>
still do not belong to us.<br/>
<br/>
When we cross the borders<br/>
we hope one of us will make it<br/>
though we know one won’t.<br/>
<br/>
Conversations are brief <br/>
and chopped; ordinary things<br/>
fill our mouths, washing the<br/>
sour taste of bleeding things.<br/>
<br/>
The lands that grow beneath<br/>
our feet are on fire too, and here<br/>
we see ourselves reflected back.</p>

<h3 id="ash_and_blue">Ash and Blue</h3>

<p>The inevitability<br/>
in certain things:<br/>
<br/>
the sky holding<br/>
thoughts, and folding<br/>
<br/>
them back slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Oak wood aging<br/>
with time, its lines the<br/>
<br/>
center of the earth, rings<br/>
resurfacing upon each other.<br/>
<br/>
Moss thickening, the<br/>
smell of morning air and<br/>
<br/>
carrying it through the day.<br/>
<br/>
The delicate composure<br/>
of small objects—<br/>
<br/>
a pen, an unloved desk,<br/>
papier-mache ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
One moment, the<br/>
self, the next, ash.</p>
