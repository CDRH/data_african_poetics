Biography: Ama Ata Aidoo is one of the best-known African writers today. Her work addresses themes of colonialism, independence, motherhood, and gender in intimate, personal ways alongside commentary on broader social issues. Although Aidoo is best known for her novels Changes: A Love Story and Our Sister Killjoy, which are widely read in women’s literature courses, and her plays The Dilemma of a Ghost and Anowa, which are read and performed all over the world, her prowess as a poet shines as well. Ama Ata Aidoo was born in Abeadzi Kyiakor, in south central Ghana in 1942. She studied literature at the University of Ghana, won a fellowship to Stanford University, and subsequently accepted visiting professorships in the United States and Africa. Her poetry collections include Birds and Other Poems, Someone Talking to Sometime, and An Angry Letter in January and Other Poems. (edited from University of Nebraska Press)</p>

<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3 id="on_reading_jackie_kay">On Reading Jackie Kay</h3>
 
<p>My Very Dear Sister,<br/>
too big a shame that<br/>
we cannot ingest, as in hog on,<br/>
a good poem.<br/>
<br/>
But beginning with you on the Isle of Man,<br/>
<br/>
we should splurge on and slurp up<br/>
great rhymes and rhythms,<br/>
stuffing our faces with<br/>
beautiful sentiments coolly expressed.<br/>
<br/>
We could pig out on those cadences<br/>
that break our hearts and gladden them—<br/>
succulent odes, romantic lyrics,<br/>
sweet and scary kwadwom, spicy oriki:<br/>
<br/>
We will hors d’ourves on haiku,<br/>
guzzle on bubbly couplets and quatrains,<br/>
gobble up the sonnets, and<br/>
their crazy line restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
Yet still and almost sated,<br/>
we shall do as the Romans did,<br/>
swigswillsip a delicate vintage and <br/>
deal with the poetry of praise, of blame, and the fearful apae.<br/>
<br/>
Then singing and dancing,<br/>
we shall go to town on free verse.<br/>
Doing our poetic bacchanalia,<br/>
drumming out our verses.<br/>
<br/>
What a global offering?<br/>
What a menu?<br/>
<br/>
My Sister,<br/>
we would drink and get drunk<br/>
with complete abandon<br/>
not worrying about<br/>
<br/>
the inches creeping up our hips, or<br/>
the sure damage to our livers.<br/>
<br/>
And then, what heaven!</p>

<h3 id="for_a_zulu_in_the_bayous">For a Zulu in the Bayous</h3>

<p>Robert,<br/>
now they say<br/>
oil is more<br/>
precious to us<br/>
than<br/>
blood.<br/>
<br/>
I believe them.<br/>
<br/>
Since we have acquired<br/>
steel heads<br/>
iron hearts and<br/>
plastic veins.<br/>
<br/>
Yet,<br/>
such a spirit as<br/>
wills humans to<br/>
glorious<br/>
softer dreams<br/>
sails from<br/>
even<br/>
the lonely wilderness of<br/>
that alien labor camp—<br/>
<br/>
your exile—<br/>
and <br/>
across the<br/>
foggy<br/>
murderous<br/>
marshes of<br/>
this corner of the world<br/>
too,<br/>
where<br/>
our people have<br/>
labored<br/>
suffered<br/>
so long and so<br/>
uselessly.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore,<br/>
as I return to<br/>
Africa,<br/>
“Our Black Mother,”<br/>
I err<br/>
to carry<br/>
this bitterness<br/>
in my mind<br/>
in my soul:<br/>
<br/>
I blame her,<br/>
her carelessness,<br/>
her generosity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for<br/>
all<br/>
our woes,<br/>
then and<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it helps any.<br/>
<br/>
And though I <br/>
refuse<br/>
to reason<br/>
myself out of<br/>
my longings and<br/>
loss of<br/>
loves that died<br/>
before they could be<br/>
born,<br/>
<br/>
something tender<br/>
brushes me<br/>
l i g h t l y <br/>
ever so lightly.<br/>
And I wonder, if it was<br/>
a hand?<br/>
a lip?<br/>
Mm…<br/>
It is the memory of <br/>
the whole of<br/>
you.</p>

<p>The healer knows<br/>
his herbs<br/>
the farmer<br/>
his seedlings<br/>
his weeds.<br/>
<br/>
If violet is a color, and<br/>
rose a flower:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br/>
violet is a flower, and<br/>
rose a color,<br/>
<br/>
then<br/>
I’ll hang around to<br/>
catch <br/>
my lessons from<br/>
your teacher’s lips.<br/>
<br/>
Child,<br/>
affection is<br/>
cashable<br/>
anytime during banking hours,<br/>
—when<br/>
assets are liquid—<br/>
<br/>
So,
how do I translate<br/>
my love,<br/>
who has<br/>
nothing else to give?</p>
