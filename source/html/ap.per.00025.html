In the 1980s, he was the Ghanaian ambassador to Brazil and Cuba and served as ambassador to the United Nations from 1990 to 1994; in 1990 he published Ghana: A Political History from Pre-European to Modern Times.

<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3 id="the_land_endures">The Land Endures</h3>

<p>patterned after blood-clots<br/>
insigniaed delivery’s weeping body<br/>
flight to places where they lock the doors<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hide the keys;<br/>
my father endures, so does my mother<br/>
miracle makers kingdom of life<br/>
in dawn’s glories where the grain is citadel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prayer.<br/>
Dawn’s glory; there is song<br/>
we shall sing it to the unison<br/>
of the blue heron<br/>
as the land endures again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in our time</p>

<h3 id="on_the_gallows_once">On the Gallows Once</h3>

<p>I crossed quite a few <br/>
of your rivers, my gods,<br/>
into this plain where thirst reigns<br/>
I heard the cry of mourners<br/>
the long cooing of the African wren at dusk<br/>
the laughter of the children at dawn<br/>
had long ceased<br/>
night comes fast in our land<br/>
<br/>
where indeed are the promised vistas<br/>
the open fields, blue skies, the singing birds<br/>
and abiding love?<br/>
<br/>
History records acts <br/>
of heroism, barbarism<br/>
of some who had power<br/>
and abused it massively<br/>
of some whose progenitors<br/>
planned for them<br/>
the secure state of madness<br/>
from which no storm can shake them;<br/>
of some who took the last ships<br/>
disembarked on some far-off shores and forgot<br/>
of some who simply laid down the load<br/>
and went home to the ancestors</p>

<h3 id="etchings_from_my_mind">Etchings from My Mind</h3>

<p>i.<br/>
Summer’s sorry surrogate heat<br/>
and the bark of magistrates<br/>
old men in ceremonial robes<br/>
dancers hoisted upon a hill<br/>
whirling on dead ants<br/>
to the cry of hornbills and cock calls.<br/>
<br/>
ii.<br/>
An owl hooted in my memory tonight,<br/>
gaslit streets, the sacramento is passing.<br/>
Night falls slowly here.<br/>
<br/>
iii.<br/>
That summer through Texas<br/>
Louisiana tropical imitations and land buyers stands<br/>
ranches, and oil magnates in ten gallon hates<br/>
bragging of their wealth and notches<br/>
on ancestral guns.<br/>
<br/>
iv.<br/>
Through a snow haze<br/>
the road to Lockhaven, nightmare route 90 West<br/>
a hallucinatory promenade<br/>
to a farmhouse and a sentry dog,<br/>
a man seven feet carrying a ten-foot gun,<br/>
gas fumes from silver hills,<br/>
death in mountains, green murder baths<br/>
in single night motels. <br/>
<br/>
v. <br/>
A festival of raw energy<br/>
and the sun shall shine in my valley.<br/>
<br/>
vi.<br/>
Will this proscenium sorrow<br/>
feed the night hunger<br/>
at the festival of leaven bread<br/>
ears of corn my temples of sorrow?<br/>
Where is the harvest of my prayers?<br/>
<br/>
across the bay come the morning<br/>
I shall wash this 37-year-old chill down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and go home.<br/>
<br/>
vii.<br/>
At the final hour comes the sorrow<br/>
pin pricks in summer’s beginning;<br/>
alarms and bustles heard<br/>
over my grave; what carnival<br/>
now are they preparing? Plotting<br/>
my death again in cactus fields<br/>
and smoky barrooms; but my phoenix<br/>
fled to the cinnamon groves<br/>
and my grave is green on top. </p>
