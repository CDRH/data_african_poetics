<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3 id="the_bees_gospel">The Bee’s Gospel</h3>

<p>I enter a household wherein a woman uses stamps with blooms:<br/>
zinnias, aster, primrose. She adorns envelopes,<br/>
remembers her mother’s destroyed marigolds,<br/>
and grieves for them again.<br/>
<br/>
At night a man puts his palm on her temple,<br/>
then her crown, unfolding meadows,<br/>
and every fruit and root.<br/>
I sit on the headboard and wait for permission to enter.<br/>
It is an expanding paradise.<br/>
Every thing knows its relationship<br/>
to light, to darkness, pursues various means to the same ends,<br/>
and his hand contains the aliving spice<br/>
of a room full of palms. <br/>
<br/>
He tells her she is the seasons.<br/>
<br/>
He pursues a single lyric, wears several musks at once.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning she splits a dense fruit.<br/>
Within it are chambers, combs.<br/>
She extracts seeds on the table, spends songs cleaning them.<br/>
<br/>
My guardian waits outside the window.<br/>
<br/>
I like how this man looks when he offers things,<br/>
every object a gift: cup, washcloth, his scented <br/>
chest and temples. I don’t know which one<br/>
is the queen, so I fly between them both.<br/>
And the backs of their necks are the same.<br/>
They are mirrors:<br/>
mirrors facing each other across a well-lit room.<br/>
I am in a frenzy.<br/>
I visit a cup whose color I can’t resist:<br/>
summer sky after three nights without rain.<br/>
it contains a sweet fluid.<br/>
I don’t know the name of this nectar.<br/>
It causes me to forget.<br/>
I have to be near it, on his knuckles, om his shoulders.<br/>
What does it want, she asks.<br/>
It doesn’t know, he says.<br/>
What does it know of what humans made?<br/>
Then he’ll go, and tell the others. He’ll recite.<br/>
They try to kill me, not sincerely.<br/>
I drop from ceiling to floor until they too are exhausted.<br/>
She opens a window. I stay, parse their fragrances<br/>
as she parsed those seeds,<br/>
I want him to lie with her again<br/>
show me multitudinous gardens.<br/>
<br/>
My attendant can wait no longer.<br/>
<br/>
I salute her bare right breast,<br/>
and watch all her skin prickle,<br/>
and her scalp change color,<br/>
and fly out.</p>

<h3 id="the_kitchen_dwellers_interlude">The Kitchen-Dweller’s Interlude</h3>

<p>I will put into this bread a storm gathering water.<br/>
Do not take me, do not include me in this,<br/>
its plea a cat’s purr, or a tree full of cicadas.<br/>
<br/>
I will uproot your olive tree. I will smooth the bark or send<br/>
something to build a fungus like a small sun in its cavities.<br/>
<br/>
What is the smell of trouble?<br/>
Love-trouble is poison on the roof of the mouth.<br/>
I want to have museum-trouble, the way the air changes<br/>
before someone cuts a portrait. <br/>
<br/>
Into this bread I put the dog that runs after his owner’s car, free as a horse.<br/>
Also a horse’s tail trying to unbraid.<br/>
And a muzzle.<br/>
<br/>
And the taste of gutter water. I stare dumbly at it.<br/>
Abase myself.<br/>
Is our love water I can’t drink?<br/>
<br/>
I blow a note into the hot oven, into the gap<br/>
between oven and countertop.</p>

<h3 id="ordinary_heaven">Ordinary Heaven</h3>

<p>I arrange a doll in a chair and wait for her to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I want to say, “Be!” but am an ordinary creation.<br/>
I watch for the folds under her eyes to twitch.<br/>
<br/>
I have many dreams, I say to her.<br/>
In my dreams I’m better than myself.<br/>
<br/>
I soften peppers in a well-greased pan and make announcements.<br/>
I say, in the afterlife we cannot allow a single particle of our light<br/>
<br/>
to diminish. I am not a woman-prophet,<br/>
but I know paradise. I have seen my soul sitting on grass.<br/>
<br/>
There, I learned God doesn’t know shame, and after six days<br/>
he allowed our atmosphere to make certain souls wince;<br/>
<br/>
we crawl under its magnificence. Here, I can attain ordinary heavens.<br/>
Here, I attend to my book of questions. What is love? What does it say,<br/>
<br/>
“Allow me to mogul your soul?” Where does it keep what it takes?<br/>
What does the prostrating shadow request? Why do rocks enslave<br/>
<br/>
water? What is the slave’s poem? Does the sea favor its roar or murmur?<br/>
The doll cannot answer. The furrow in her bottom lip suggests<br/>
<br/>
that entry into ordinary heaven only requires recognition of it,<br/>
for the soul’s arrogance to weigh less than a mustard seed.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for you, I tell her.<br/>
You witness but don’t testify.</p>
