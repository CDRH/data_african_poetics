"recy0H6MnGNN8f9IO","apdp.commentary.000001","A Critical Reading of John Willett’s “Literature as Symptom","<p>John Willett, journalist and assistant editor of the Times Literary Supplement (1960-67) in London, writes about the literature coming out of Africa, claiming that Africa is ""making history quicker than she is making literature, and in some ways it is an embarrassing experience."" The Times Literary Supplement was/is based in the U.K. and was well-known for its critique of writers internationally, claiming to ""scrutinize and dissect"" the writings of said international writers. Willett alludes to the idea that Africa was lacking literary activity, favoriting the white voices of European writers through his assertion that white writers were excluded from consideration at the conference, which was the ""Conference of African Writers of English Expression"" at Makerere College in 1962. The conference was attended by many prominent African writers, such as Christopher Okigbo, in which the topics of what constitutes African literature, are writings reflecting African experience, and whether African literature had been written in African languages were discussed and critiqued by writers including Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Christopher Okigbo, Ngugi wa Thiong'o who were famously in attendance.</p>

<p>The conference was met with a lot of controversy, as highlighted by Willett in his article, in which many African writers refused to acknowledge non-African languages as being African literature. For Willett, this is what constitutes his disapproval of African literature and African history, assuming that these African writers who wish to oppose the colonial rule that had governed their societies are not following the ""guidelines"" set out by European expectations of literature. Willett makes the case for this by suggesting that African writers should acknowledge white audiences in making their writings accessible, but he also hints that African writers should be thankful for the British publishing industry. Ezekiel Mphahlele, South African writer, artist, and activist who was also in attendance at the conference, had stated that ""a writer should not fear to do violence to standard English if he feels it cumbersome."" In response to this, Willett says, in reference to Mphahlele's question of who these African writers were writing for, an African audience or a ""world-wide one using English,"" </p>

<blockquote>""This question is largely of publishing facilities, and it is
 not irrelevant that of the twenty-seven books (by participants and others)
 listed in the bibliography at the end twenty were published by British firms.""</blockquote>

<p>Here, it is quite evident that Willett is willing to support the European standards of literature and language as contributions to African writing.</p>

<p>Willett seemingly refuses to acknowledge any non-English African literature, upholding the Western view on African literature as inferior and unsuccessful if it is inaccessible to the ""world-wide"" audience using English. For Willett, a dichotomy is being placed in regards to African literature; it is either favoring the Western aesthetics or to be judged and deemed in the state of infancy when it comes to African literature. When Willett touches on Christopher Okigbo, he does so in the words of Ulli Beier, German editor, writer and scholar, where Willet praises Beier's critique of the field of African literature (specifically Nigerian literature). He says that Beier had confined himself to the works of Christopher Okigbo, J.P. Clark, and Dennis Brutus, but then suggest that Beier ""had not seen more than six or seven poems by such other promising writers as Wole Soyinka and Gabriel Okara,"" in which it is unknown if Beier had actually made this statement or not. In many ways, Willett is pushing for Beier to disregard emerging African writers, distinguishing them as incapable of producing extraordinary work to catch the Western eye as other writers may have already done. Willett says, ""We are certainly far from being able to speak of African literature as a whole,"" which is far from what the conference entailed. The conference had consisted of many African men and women who were bound to create ""within the next decade a corpus of writing which is today seriously read and critically valued in many parts of the world,"" as stated by Chinua Achebe in James Currey's <em>Leeds African Studies Bulletin</em>. <p>

<p>Achebe's prediction and aspirations for African literature proved accurate while Willett's pessimism of the field unfounded, since within the decade came an outpour of African literature, which included the emergence of African writers such as Dennis Brutus, Kofi Awoonor, Okot B'tek, Buchi Emecheta, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, and Mongo Beti, among many others. There was also the Heinemann Book Series, which sought to ensure a voice to major African writers such as Chinua Achebe, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Steve Biko, Ama Ata Aidoo, as well as other prominent African writers. Within the decade, the Heinemann Book Series had published over 120 works by African writers alone. <p>

<p>When it comes to Christopher Okigbo's work in regards to Willet's claims that African literature is far away from being discussed, it can be concluded that Willet had not given a nod to Okigbo's poetry and protest, his writings on African culture and sympathy for the political aspirations of the African writers emerging in and out of independence. He had made the declared assumption that African literature was at a crossroads; either immersing itself in European aesthetics or failing to achieve literary excellence out of the country as a whole. He calls the efforts of the conference that many of these phenomenal and legendary writers had attended as ""very scattered,"" which fails to recognize that the conference was not concerned with favoring European standards and expectations. Okigbo was a published author of three volumes of poetry, even as his life was cut short after dying in the Biafran war. He had written <em>Heavensgate</em> (1962), <em>Limits</em> (1964), and <em>Silences</em> (1965), and as stated by the Encyclopedia Britannica, had poems that appeared posthumously in 1971 ""under the title <em>Labyrinths, with Path of Thunder</em>."" To claim that this Nigerian poet, and many others, were scattered and incapable of being discussed, fails to recognize the African culture that Okigbo and his contemporaries alluded to in their works. Okigbo is one of the most anthologized African poets, was an editor of <em>Transition</em>, an African literary magazine, awarded for his works, and dedicated to establishing a publishing company in Enugu. <p>

<p>As Willett settles with the assumed lack of consideration for white audiences and writers, writers like Okigbo oppose Willet's assertions, giving voice to emerging writers their contemporaries for decades to come. There are no ""scattered patches of literary activity"" as Willett states; there is the opposition of colonial standards that African writers fought for (such as the conference), dismantling the cycle of oppression that had been placed upon them. <p>

"recLpGKc0Rce1XFv8","apdp.commentary.000002","“A Critical Reading of Robert Fraser’s Comments on Christopher Okigbo in His TLS Article, “Far Remove”","<p>Robert Fraser examines Christopher Okigbo's life through the eyes of those inspired by Okigbo's life and poetry before, during, and after the Biafran war, specifically Obi Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo, <em>Thirsting for Sunlight</em>, where we gain insight into Okigbo's place in a world that was predominately shaped by European standards and assertions of political turmoil and docility, in which Okigbo diverts our attention from, having the reader focus solely on his prophetic and lyrical journey of the African poetry coming out of, in this case, Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960 and before it as well. Not preoccupied with the pessimistic assumptions of the readers of his poetry in relation to the political nature surrounding his writing, Okigbo is more preoccupied with the spiritual pilgrimage through ""dislocation but travels through realization to a state of completion or recreation,"" (Nwosu 73), as mentioned in <em>Christopher Okigbo and the Postcolonial Market of Memories</em>. </p>
<p>Fraser accuses Africa as a continent ""eager for heroes,"" which ultimately brings in how African writers and readers are deemed eager for saviorism after their colonization, and/or during their colonization. Here, it is presumed that Fraser takes Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo as a lesson on the complexity of Okigbo's work, more pessimistic than optimistic as Okigbo or Nwakanma may have hoped for their readers. Fraser seems to indicate that Okigbo's contemporaries are playing catch up when it comes to creating work inspired by Okigbo's poetry, which is ultimately a narrative too often seen in Western media. While it may be difficult to draw the same tone and lyricism from Okigbo, to presume it as a ""rise to more bad imitations that any other poet"" is rooted in an oppressive cycle of cynicism and pessimism for future African poets from the Western scene. Okigbo was courageous, as Fraser mentions, but Fraser also mentions that the only constant that Okigbo had was his verse. This alludes to the idea that Okigbo was rebellious in nature, instable when it came to sticking to one place at one time, but Okigbo is seemingly aware that stability in nature is uncertainty in the journey of his poetic form and writing in general. What I mean here is that Fraser seems to be contradictory in portraying Okigbo for the writer of Igbo folklore, the classical and the natural, as mentioned in Nwakanma's biography of Okigbo. </p>
<p> From what is seen in his poetry, Okigbo does not romanticize the ideas of colonialism and politics of the upcoming Biafran war, but in this article, Fraser seems to be insinuating that Okigbo is driven by the ""political turmoil"" of Nigerian post-independence. Okigbo work is seemingly intertwined with reassertion of culture and resistance to the colonial atmosphere, as seen in his prophetic verse and lyrical form. We see this in Siren Limits(?), published in 1962 (?), in which Okigbo writes, </p>
<blockquote><p><em>""I have had my cleansing…<br/>
Emigrant with air-borne nose"" </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Okigbo does not give life to the colonial implications of British rule, but rather signifies the buoyance of hope and reemerged culture as he hints at in the verse above. He has ""had his cleansing"" of the European standards and assertions of submissiveness, but has regained hope in the face of constant movement. </p>
<p>Here we see lyrical intertwined with the spiritual, in which Okigbo gives us insight into the journey of memories of home and movement, seeking affection for the past. Combining what is presumed to be his Christian affiliation and the Igbo identity that he held dear, Okigbo grants us the reemergence of his homecoming to the post-colonial world. He writes in Distances (1964) (?):</p>
<blockquote><p><em> ""But what does my divine rejoicing hold? A bowl of incense, a nest of fireflies?<br/>
 I was the sole witness to my homecoming."" </em></p></blockquote>
  <p>We witness Okigbo's homecoming from that of the Western influence on African identities and writings, but Okigbo grants us a homecoming of culture and immersive lyricism and idiom, which Fraser seemingly fails to mention in this news article. Focused primarily on Okigbo's constant state of movement, Fraser takes Nwakanma's biography in contradictory stances, insisting that it is a hard project to take on but that the author is concerned with making Okigbo favored in the eyes of his subjects. Fraser does not mention Okigbo's poetry and resistance to the colonial narratives placed upon himself and his contemporaries but mentions Okigbo's ""faults"" and distancing of his mental place, insinuating them as inconsistencies rather than planned out experiences by Okigbo himself. A difficult approach to the article rests with Fraser's intentions on reviewing Obi Nwakanma's biography in light of Okigbo's work and influence in and out of Africa; is Fraser preoccupied with the life of Okigbo as a soldier, in which the life of Okigbo in relation to his military involvement is brought in appropriately, or is Fraser more preoccupied with the disagreement of Okigbo's choices as a poet? <p>

"rectAo5Qm2VddHjsp","apdp.commentary.000003","Wole Soyinka in The Times Advertisements and Announcements between 1965 and 1983","<p><em>The Times and The Times Literary Supplement</em> catered to an international audience, and Wole Soyinka's significant presence shows the influence of his work and a record of the scope of his audience. Soyinka had ten mentions in advertisements and announcements in the Times and the Times Literary Supplement between 1965 and 1983.</p>

<p>Even though Wole Soyinka had written four poetry collections by 1976, <em>Idanre and Other Poems</em> (1969), <em>A Big Airplane Crashed into the Earth</em> (original title Poems from Prison) (1969), <em>A Shuttle in the Crypt</em> (1972), <em>Ogun Abibiman</em> (1976), and was anthologized in collections like <em>Modern Poetry in Africa</em> (1963), he was advertised in The Times far more times as a playwright than a poet. In a 1972 advertisement of the book <em>Wole Soyinka</em> published in the new Modern African Writers, a book series under the stables of Evans UK, Soyinka is described as a, ""…remarkable Nigerian writer, best known as a major dramatist but also widely praised as a poet, novelist and commentator.""</p>

<p>Most of Soyinka's early poetry collections were published by the one-man publishing company  of Rex Collings Ltd. It is possible the publisher didn't have the resources to advertise in The  Times, or may have not seen the advantages of such advertisements, and this may be responsible for the collections' lack of exposure in The Times.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Modern Poetry in Africa</em> published by Penguin Books in 1963</li>
  <li><em>Idanre and Other Poems</em> published by Eyre Methuen and Company in 1969</li>
  <li><em>A Big Airplane Crashed into the Earth</em>, original title <em>Poems from Prison</em>, published by Rex Collings in 1969</li>
  <li><em>A Shuttle in the Crypt</em> published by Rex Collings/Eyre Methuen in 1972</li>
  <li><em>Ogun Abibiman</em> published by Rex Collings in 1976</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it should be noted the Rex Collins in his capacity as Wole Soyinka's publisher wrote an open letter in the ""Letters to the Editor"" page of The Times of Tuesday, June 10, 1969, asking that Soyinka who was then in prison in Nigeria for treason to be treated with compassion.</p>

<p>Book publishers and theatres advertised regularly in The Times and The Times Literary Supplement, and the consistent advertisement of the works of African writers and artists indicate the relevance of their works or that there was an audience and market for them. Soyinka's novel, <em>The Interpreters</em>, was included in the Times English Books of the 1960s. The Negro Theatre Workshop, still in the process of registering as a trust and non-profit, advertised a special charity review of Wole Soyinka's play, <em>The Road</em>.</p>

<p>The 1965 advertisement for three plays titled ""Season of African Plays"" announces Wole Soyinka, as a dramatic writer, actor, and producer known in Nigeria and Britain, whose play, <em>The Road</em>, was the highlight of the Commonwealth Arts festival of 1966. Unlike Soyinka, the writer of the third play, <em>The Knot</em>, the highly regarded white South African Playwright, Athol Fugard didn't get an introduction.</p>

<p>The 1966 advertisement titled ""Nigerian play for Court Theater"" touts Wole Soyinka's credentials—his degree from the University of Leeds and connection to the Royal Court Theatre group of writers—before the actual announcement of the play. The advert reads like his talents and credibility had to be marketed to this audience who, one may presume, would find great value in Soyinka's training in the west.  No mention is given of Soyinka's degree at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, a school he attended with his famous compatriots Christopher Okigbo and China Achebe. Nevertheless, the showing of the play in question, <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em>, was postponed because of a sick, unnamed director, this was announced in a subsequent advertisement. Soyinka's connection with the University of Leeds and the Royal Court Theatre no doubt gave him access to the British audience and by extension the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The only image in the ten announcements/advertisements of Soyinka's works is a black and white picture of what would later be synonymous with the Soyinka brand, his full afro. In 1972, Evans UK used this image twice to advertise its nonfiction titles in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>. Soyinka's works were included in both books, <em>Modern African Writers</em>, and <em>Introduction to Nigerian Literature</em>—a critical assessment of traditional drama, oral poetry, and printed literature in major Nigerian languages.</p>

<p>Heinemann in 1972, paid for an advertisement to commemorate the publication of its 100th paperback book in the ""world famous"" African Writers Series, <em>Girls at War</em> by Chinua Achebe. Wole Soyinka's book, <em>The Interpreters</em> is listed as the 76th book.</p>

<p>In 1978, Heinemann Educational Books, a division of Heinemann, advertised a wide array of books from all over the world. Soyinka gets a mention in the second edition of <em>The Literature and Thought of Modern Africa</em>.</p>

<p>The South African publisher David Philip had an interesting advert titled ""Publishers are Defined by Their Authors."" Why did this South African publisher decide on this title for its 1983 advert in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>? The publisher announced its stand against apartheid. David Philip was one of very few South African publishers that published black Africans and anti-apartheid activists during apartheid. It is no wonder that Soyinka, who was a strong critic of successive Nigerian military governments was included in the roll call of David Philip authors.</p>

<p>The announcements for Soyinka's plays were published in 1965-6 and book advertisements in the 1970s. An analysis of his work in announcements and advertisements shows that Soyinka's mentions shifted from plays to fiction, poetry, and critical essays, though the attention to his poetry was fairly scant. There was a lull, and the Nigerian Civil War may have been responsible for this, between 1967 and 1970. Soyinka was outspoken critic of the war and appealed to both sides—the Nigerian federal government and Biafra—for a ceasefire. For his activism, he was imprisoned without trial for treasonable acts for twenty-two months by the federal government.</p>

  <footer> (Dickinson, from <cite>Voice of the Poets</cite>) </footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The epigraph above reflects the common racist rhetoric found in British criticism of mid-20th century African writers. On September 13, 1965 <em>The Times Supplement On the Arts in the Commonwealth</em> posted an article by contributor Patrick Dickinson titled ""Voice of the Poets."" In it, Dickinson examines the poetry written by commonwealth poets in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Africa, especially their relationship with, and ability to wield, an English language that is representative of place. Of the antipodes he says, ""The problem of their poets has been and still is to write in a tongue which is their own, a rhythm of speech which reflects their own vernacular. But they do not want to be ""regional"""" (Dickinson). Unlike the Canadian poet, however, the African poet, Dickinson claims, is aware of other languages, very likely grew up speaking other languages, and therefore ""may still be writing in translation"" (Dickinson). He describes the African ""fascination"" with language as a detriment to creating a wholly African poetry removed from the shadow of the likes of Eliot. ""African poetry it seems to me must be (and is) fascinated by language. ""A primrose by the river's brim"" is part of the conventional imagery of exile to Antipodians or Canadians. To an African, reading Wordsworth must be a mystery"" (Dickinson).</p>

<p>Contemporary African writers such as Chimamanda Adichie and Nugugi Wa Thiongo among others have written about the ""foreignness"" of their English colonial education, specifically that the language of letters and learning, thus the language of social uplift, did not reflect their culture or communities. Never do they infer that this foreignness was based on a lack of understanding. On the contrary, the ""mystery"" of Wordsworth (if there was one) was about lack of representation, not an inability to decode the language of the colonizers. If they are mystified by anything, it's the culture of the colonizers, not the language they wield.</p>

<p>Dickinson uses ""foreignness"" as a way to explain this perceived African ""fascination"" with language. It is not an endearing fascination he speaks of, but a patronizing fascination that is rendered childlike in its awe of the toy hanging just out of reach. Not only does Dickinson's critique drip with condescension, but it is steeped in the false assumption that the African ""fascination"" with the English language is a barrier to writing evocatively and authentically about place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>African poets like Wole Soyinka or Christopher Okigbo are entrancing and entranced by language. Either they write of people or ideas. There is no yearn for the exposition of landscape to bolster nationality. Their aim is to write like... how would this sentence go on?...Like T.S. Eliot? He may well stand for this sort of expatriate poetry. Eliot changed his personal voice; his rhythms are neither Boston nor East Coker but rather from Atlantis. English African poetry has at the moment this quality of nowhere, of being translated from a language no one has ever conversed in.</p>
  <footer>(Dickinson)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentiment, while false, is also fundamentally xenophobic. To believe that understanding English literature is some kind of inherited, quasi-biological undertaking is a highly problematic assumption steeped in inherent racist ideology. In addition, Dickinson's definition of place is limited and based entirely on an English understanding of what constitutes landscape/culture and thus what could and should ""bolster nationality."" Dickinson is not the only one.</p>

<p>If we look at ""Eng. Lit. expands,"" a 1969 review by Norman Jeffares of <em>The Chosen Tongue: English Writing in the Tropical World </em>, an anthology edited by Gerald Moore, we see similar problematic rhetoric used to critique African writers. In this case Jeffares juxtaposes the African with the West Indian writer. While Jeffares doesn't go as far as Dickinson in claiming that African writers fail to yearn for an exposition of landscape and thus produce writing insulated from the discourse of nationalism, he does suggest that the African writer is too imaginatively-preoccupied with, and limited by, their country of origin. Of the West Indian writer, Jeffares says, ""The West Indian… speaks an international language, the unique language of the British West Indies dialect forms, a medley of structures and vocabulary derived from non-English sources"" (Jeffares).</p>

<p>His thoughts on the African writer are quite different— ""He finds more scope in living and working in his own country"" (Jeffares). While the West Indian writer calls forth the shores of Africa, the African writer, according to Jeffares, does not call forth the islands. Where the ""West Indian, makes his pilgrimage, searching for his ancestral memories, travelling to a distant town, and through time, through history, to a new knowledge of himself"" and back again, ""for the African, what is past or passing or to come makes up the contemporary community: and the modern African writer often reacts violently against it"" (Jeffares).</p>

<p>Jeffares does go on to list a handful of African writers that seem to make up an exception to his claim: Soyinka, Awoonor-Williams, Achebe, Okigbo and Clark. ""The richness, the range of choice, open to the West African writer, both in subject and style, is vast"" (Jeffares), but apparently this richness is only ""open"" to the African writer, not accessed or utilized by the majority of African writers of the time. This criticism feeds into the all too common, yet troubling narrative, that Africa, and it's cultural and artistic productions, is in a constant state of becoming, but never arriving, an adolescent that never reaches adulthood. This intentionally benevolent narrative has been all too successful in rendering Africa and its productions as in need of patronage, instead of a multitude of existing cultures with ""moral ideas and myths of enduring value"" (Dickinson) of their own.</p>

<p>However, this was not a sentiment unique to the 1960's. Almost fifteen years later, contributor M.M. Carlin reviews another anthology of African writing for <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> titled ""Understanding African Poetry: A Study of Ten Poets"" edited by Ken Goodwin. In ""Scorning the Sonnet"" Carlin echoes Dickinson's claim that the English language and the African writer do not mix. For Carlin, French is a more nuanced and eloquent language for the African writer. While English, with its heavy stresses and ""strong metrical beat, together with an easygoing critical attitude, have – at least to begin with – resulted in far too much African poetry whose flatness only serves to point up the ""influences"" – Hopkins, Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Dylan Thomas – the outcome of which is often mere pastiche"" (Carlin). According to Carlin, the durable African poems are the ones that are explicitly political by the likes of writers such as Okigbo, Soyinka, Okara, Owooner and few others. Like Jeffares, Carlin looks towards the future for the African writers who will one day wield an English representative of Africa and not it's canonical figures.</p>

<p>What these critiques make clear is that for the African writer in the 20th century to be well-received by the British literati was an acrobatic undertaking, a circus of mirrors. It required a multiplicity of allegiances and back bends that would exhaust the most dexterous of English language speakers. I'd guess that for the African writers of the time, what Carlin, Jeffares and Dickinson's racist gaze refused to see, was not only exhausting—it was deafening.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
M.M. Carlin was a British teacher of English Literature in Africa. The specific university and country is not readily available. He seems to have published mostly in the 1960's. The articles from this period (available online) were published by Indiana University Press. There is little information online about Carlin, but based on the subject matter of his articles, it's possible to assume he lived and taught in South Africa. Carlin's work focuses mostly on critiquing published articles by English men on the state of Africa and its cultural productions. Other works by Carlin include film reviews and a critique of an article about revolution and partition in South Africa published by the English South African journal, Encounter, of which he writes, ""There is a South Africa but she does not know herself"" and ""Perhaps the South African English, in their trance of dilemma, are the first actual South Africans?""</p>

Achebe, Brooks claims, ""leaned perhaps too far the other way,"" quoting Achebe as saying that ""an African creative writer who tries to avoid the big social and political issues of contemporary Africa will end up being completely irrelevant."" Brooks, it should be noted, was not primarily a scholar of African writing; a British novelist, playwright, and poet, Brooks was most famous for his 1960 novel <em>Jampot Smith</em>. This positioning of his is perhaps a half-formed and certainly a reductive one, and places both Okigbo's and Achebe's words without context or nuance, instead implying a binary in ideologies which ignores the larger complexities of the authors' positionalities. Although Brooks' review ultimately focuses on Ekwensi's novel, his mention of Okigbo—and the fact that he positions him ideologically against such a well-known novelist—is telling of both the gap in attention to African poetry at the time in this and other similar publications, as well as the collapsing of poetry as a genre into a larger umbrella of African literature. It's also illuminating in the way Brooks discusses that large category of African literature in relation to English writers.</p>

<p>After quoting Okigbo and Achebe and framing their viewpoints in opposition to one another, Brooks is insistent on positioning the work of African writers in relation to British writers, stating that post-colonial African writing ""has a driving urgency, a new minted freshness of expression which a British writer could no more ape than he can experience for himself the sense of direction and position that gives such authority to nineteenth century English fiction."" Brooks also claims that African literature ""is not to be defined by degrees of involvement in specifically African issues,"" suggesting that he's posing a middle ground between Okigbo and Achebe's stances, and yet his previous statement seems to contradict that claim. In describing African writing as something that no British writer could mimic, Brooks suggests that there is an innate quality to writing coming out of Africa—and belonging to <em>all</em> African writing, regardless of region, a claim that is problematic at best. His attempt to ""define"" African literature might stem from his attempts to understand or equate African writing in ways similar to how he understands British writing—which, considering the immense differences in scale of both place, people, and culture, is not a productive assessment.</p>

<p>This framing of African writing in relation to English writing is not singular to Brooks, by far. In another article published in 1976 in The Times Literary Supplement, M.M. Carlin reviews Ken Goodwin's <em>Understanding African Poetry: A Study of Ten Poets</em>. Carlin, who was a British teacher of English literature in Africa, worked primarily (in the articles available online) in critiquing articles by English men who were writing about Africa, mostly in the 1960's. In his review, Carlin points to Goodwin's way of placing the ten poets he discusses (including Okigbo) ""in the order of their Africanness, their independence of European models,"" which Carlin says ""forms a socio-cultural description of African poetry."" According to Carlin, Goodwin's distinction seems to favor the group of poets who he categorizes as writing most ""African"" (Gabriel Okara, Okot p'Bitek, and Mazisi Kunene). He writes that, in contrast, Dennis Brutus, Christopher Okigbo, Lenrie Peters, and John Pepper Clark all ""remained largely captive to the European, and particularly the British, tradition of poetry."" There seems to be an impulse here, on both Goodwin and Carlin's part, to separate English traditions—even the English language—from African writing, suggesting that the essence of African poetry is incompatible with English traditions and language, or that, at the very least, it's weakened by the attempt to harness forms such as the sonnet in finding their poetic voice. What this reading doesn't acknowledge or allow for, however, is the fact that writers like Okigbo, who have been trained in the British literary tradition, are also complicating that tradition and putting pressure on it. This also speaks especially to discussions in and around Wole Soyinka's <em>Myth Literature and the African World</em> (Cambridge, 1976), and especially Ngugi wa Thiong'o's <em>Decolonizing the Mind</em> (Heinemann, 1986), which speaks to complicated questions of language—and a writer's choice of language—in nations in which indigenous and colonial languages are used. </p>

"recHDGHYtBcAJV1EY","apdp.commentary.000006","A Commentary on M.M Carlin’s 1983 Book Review of Ken Goodwin’s “Understanding African Poetry: A study of Ten Poets”with a Focus on Soyinka.","<p>Whether it is acknowledged or not, African writers, and indeed poets, live within the confluence of two or more traditions/languages, and their poetics emerge from the spaces where these worlds and languages collide. This is a commentary on the review of M.M Carlin, which interrogates Ken Goodwin's textual analysis and evaluation of ten African poets. Goodwin held the under-studied poets to account, through western standards and traditions of poetry.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, perhaps due to the lack of understanding of what African poetry is, most critical conversation fixates on thematic content and the socio-political context in which the poetry exists, and its criticism is restricted and viewed only through that limited lens. Consequently, its merits are assessed on its relative ""Africanness"", which is defined largely along the same socio-political lines mentioned above.</p>

<p>In Carlin's review published in the Times Literary Supplement of 16th September 1983, he explained that Goodwin's book categorized the poets ""roughly in the order of their Africanness, their dependence of European Models"" which aided the summing up of a group that included what was described as the ""Internationalists"" which are the poets who remained perpetual captives of the British  tradition of poetry (Dennis Brutus, Christopher Okigbo, Lenrie Peters and John Pepper Clark) and the second group which included poets like Taban, Awoonor and Soyinka, who synthesized indigenous African traditions and the European Traditions. And the last group who Goodwin claimed, ""were able to write as Africans with only minimal influence from Europe"".</p>

<p>A cursory look, at the Heinemann African writers' series which published poets like Christopher Okigbo, Gabriel Okara, Leopold Senghor, Tchicaya U'Tam'si among numerous others, makes the case that the series was already defining the African poetry ""canon"", which allowed for a more diverse representation of writing styles, influences and complexities of the broader African poetry landscape unlike Goodwin's categorization which defined African poetry from a reductionist perspective that paid no attention to the poetry that was emerging due to Africa's gruesome colonial history with Europe.</p>


<p>African poetry cannot be viewed ""independent of European model"" and certainly not dependent on a European model. To this point, this commentary will focus on the second group, specifically Wole Soyinka. Carlin's review expressed Eurocentric conceit, declaring that ""…historians may one day conclude that French was the best European language for African poetry."" Taking this expression at face value, the implication is that, even more than in African languages, African poetry flourishes most, in French. Perhaps Carlin's argument could be a comparison between French and English but that fails because why make such a comparison in the context of African poetry where both languages are not indigenous?</p>

<p>That declaration was made perhaps in a genuine fit of excitement that ""the distribution of stress in French, the flexibility of French meter offered Francophone poets in Africa the right combination of ease and authority [while] English on the other hand, demands of a heavily stressed language, with metrical beat, together with an easygoing critical attitude, have—at least to begin with— resulted in a far too much African poetry whose flatness only serves to point up the ""influences""—Hopkins, Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Dylan Thomas— the outcome of which is often mere pastiche"".</p>

<p>It is, however, a disingenuous assertion on the part of Carlin, who despite his declaration did not provide sufficient evidence to back it up, because there was only one francophone African poet, Lenrie Peters, in the list.</p>

<p>More so, that is a stunning surmising of what African poetry in English is, which is not only a great misreading but an acute imprudence that lies in the persistence of the patronizing colonial notion that all colonized people are seeking to enact the Caliban dynamic of attempting to ""master"" the language of the colonized. Reading influence in this limited political manner is both condescending and self-congratulatory, because African poets are contributing to the world of poetry, something that grows out of equally complex and profoundly sophisticated traditions that are not necessarily European.</p>

<p>Another implication of Carlin's assertion is that there were no original African poets, at least at that time, writing in English, which is self-contradictory of both himself and Goodwin's own categorization, which implied that poets like Soyinka wrote within the fringes and influences of both worlds, which at worst offers a hybridization that gives birth to a new language and perhaps tradition. Carlin's explanation that ""the most interesting and durable poems of the writers presented in <em>Understanding African Poetry</em> are in the broadly political- that is, they have something to say"" which infers that the African poet's politicization of poetry represents a dearth. He also stated that Goodwin's ""mild chidings [was] respectful and even reverential in tone"". This cynicism, however, suggests that the poetic value of the African poet is disconnected from poetics, and its strength is solely rooted in the subject. This does not consider that when a poem, for instance, captures the moment it yearns to represent, it causes an emotional reaction in its reader. Such a poem goes just beyond a reliance on subject for strength because it must have succeeded as a vehicle, found a language through which the subject could be experienced and understood. Goodwin stating that Afrikaans being a native European language points to a slight bias towards how African poetry is perceived under the scrutiny of western gaze. Afrikaans is perhaps a naturalized African language that evolved and developed out of a European language on the continent. Perhaps, historically, it cannot be considered indigenous to Africa like English and French, but still, hardly will both languages be considered as indigenous to Africa.</p>

<p>It is worthy to note that these African writers are writing fully aware of the European tradition, and wrestling with the indignity of having their own cultural and poetic traditions demeaned and degraded by European chauvinism.  So, the poets are being influenced by European traditions, which all would agree, moved them, challenged them and ""inspired"" them.  And inspiration may well be driven by the core impulse of the writer to find a voice ultimately truer to experience and culture through the powerful position of one feeling free to draw on any tradition presented to them out of a confidence in their grounding in language and place—in this case, wherever they are in Africa.  What these critics are doing is infantilizing African writers who are in fact approaching their work with the authority of feeling able to appropriate from the western tradition to suit their purpose, and to, in the process, critique that very tradition. These critics are only able to see imitation, and incapable of seeing the African poet as writing with authority.</p>

<p>M.M Carlin offered a contradiction that is not only interesting but should have been an opportunity for him to find better answers to his curiosity. Carlin stated that ""it would be impossible to find ten English poets of comparable age who had the same collective experiences of oppression, imprisonment, violence and war"" as the African poets. His posture admits that African poets possess a genuine experience that ""inspires far better poetry of their European counterparts"", but flatly panders to the expectation that African poets should uphold a British/Western tradition, in this instance the sonnet, or be judged by a tradition, as he puts, that does not inspire the kind of authentic language that lived experiences do.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Wole Soyinka is not just an English speaker but also a Yoruba speaker, who is rooted in its traditions and like other bilingual or multilingual speakers, and poets influenced by the languages they speak.</p>

<p>It is true that both Carlin and Goodwin are writing outside of the African poetry tradition and experiencing it through a bias that is detrimental to their understanding it and writing in their ignorance of the poetic culture which is where the misreading of both Carlin and Goodwin emerges from and the unwillingness to see through a different lens.</p>

<p>Though Carlin recognized and paid attention to the influence that experiences complicate, in the poetics of these poets, there is seemingly a lack of acknowledgement of how, Yoruba which is Soyinka's first language complicates his writing in English, and  amplifies everything from sentence construction to meter and ultimately rhythm, since his poetry exists in a reality that is an intersection of English and Yoruba.<p>

"recWKgWNR659EIyBD","apdp.commentary.000007","Christopher Okigbo in Three British Newspaper Reports Between 1966 and 1993","<p>Christopher Okigbo was born in Ojoto, Nigeria in 1932 and studied Western classics at the University of Ibadan. He joined the Biafran side during the Nigerian Civil War and was killed in 1967 during an offensive by Nigerian forces against Nsukka. He published three poetry collections, <em>Heavensgate</em> (1962), <em>Limits</em> (1964), <em>Silences</em> (1965), and a posthumous collection in 1971 titled, <em>Labyrinths</em>.<p>

<p>The legacy of Okigbo the Poet-Soldier is chronicled in three news reports: ""A Poet in Arms (Guns, Sub-machine 9mm, 1007)"" an <em>Insight</em> story, ""Full Analysis of the War Awaited"" by Kaye Whiteman ""of West Africa,"" and ""The Arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa"" by A.M Daniels. Together, these three reports provide a view of Okigbo's pre-war political ideologies and legacy chronicled in western media. Even in literary discourses, Okigbo is often cited in connection to the circumstances of his death, this helped to create a myth around his poetry and legacy.</p>
<p>The first report, ""A Poet in Arms (Guns, Sub-machine 9mm, 1007)"" published in the ""Insight"" column of <em>The Sunday Times</em> of October 30, 1966 refers to Okigbo, W. B Yeats, Patrick Pearse, Garcia Lorca, Geothe, and Byron as ""…poets doubling as men of action.""</p>

<p> <em>The Sunday Times</em> was launched in 1822, it promised to uphold the freedom of the press against anyone who would stifle it. In 1963, it formed the Insight team, which became world famous for cutting-edge investigative journalism. The ""Insight"" team broke many of the key stories of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The ""Insight"" report describes an illicit arms deal in Birmingham, ""[Okigbo] planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1007 submachine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria."" Okigbo was said to have changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to board an ""ancient DC 4."" The plane crashed in Cameroon, and Okigbo's suitcase and books were found in its wreckage. </p>

<p>The ""Insight"" report carries an interesting comment, ""His poetry, as at yet, shows no signs of political commitment."" This comment is important because Okigbo was still alive when this was published. It may represent the beginning of the popularization of associating politics, protests, and wars with the poet. Indeed, the construction of romantic revolutionary heroic figures was not uncommon in that time.  The medical doctor and Cuban revolutionary, Che Guevara, stands out as the poster child of such figures, and Okigbo's identity was being constructed in the same mold.  The ""Insight"" quoting one of T. S Elliot's refrains ""&amp; the mortar is not yet dry…"" alludes to a future where Okigbo would write of his war experiences.</p>

<p>The second report ""Full Analysis of the War Awaited"" by Kaye Whiteman published in <em>The Financial Times</em> of March 6, 1972 is a complaint about the inability of Nigerian writers to write about the Nigerian Civil War. Whiteman attributes the unavailability of war stories to the survivors urge to bury the past in the postwar mood of reconciliation, and the discreet silence maintained by the main actors in the war who still hold valuable posts in government.</p>

<p>Martin Kaye Whiteman, journalist and editor, was born 9 March 1936 and died 17 May 2014. His obituary in <em>The Guardian</em> reads that, ""He met most of the key African leaders from the period of decolonisation and independence, both English- and French-speaking, and was in touch with many of those involved in public service throughout the continent. Whiteman also reported on the Nigerian civil war of 1967-70, witnessing the surrender of the Biafran general Philip Effiong to General Yakubu Gowon of the federal government."" Whiteman was the deputy editor, editor, editor-in-chief, and general manager of the weekly <em>West Africa</em> magazine. He was a contributing editor of <em>Africa Today<em> from 2002 onwards. His advocated for African journalism, the history of the continent and its preservation. He wrote a book, <em>Lagos: A Cultural and Historical Companion</em> (2012). </p>
<p>Whiteman doesn't show any concern for the lives lost during the war or the effect of the Nigerian Civil war on the country, rather he focuses on Nigeria being ""…an immensely rich field for any researcher interested in building a picture of what was…""  He specifies the type of researchers by casually adding that, ""…there are few if any outsiders who are able, willing or qualified to do this."" Whiteman declares the few available accounts of the war as unreliable and meaningless, but desires that the dairies kept by Nigerian soldiers during the war be published. He justifies his demand to know, by mentioning the need to archive history. </p>

<p>Some may argue that these war stories archived in history would be a testimonial of the experiences of victims, but this is not the case the Whiteman is making.  The stories he craves wouldn't be for the gain of the war victims, but an opportunity for outsiders to experience the war through the chronicled accounts of victims. </p>

<p>Whiteman drags Okigbo into this conversation, a sort of rude awakening of the dead to partake in a conversation he was not privy to. He recaps Okigbo's activities during the war in one sentence, ""Okigbo joined the Biafra war and was killed"" an allusion to the poet-soldier legacy. Okigbo's use in the report ends abruptly in that single line. Whiteman notes the impact of the war on creative writing by furthering the stance of the Insight team report, Okigbo's yet to be defined politics, ""…Nigeria's writers not initially very obviously politically committed, became caught up in the turbulence of event."" He ends the his report with the hope that the war stories would be written in the future, ""…if sensibilities were numbed, there is now, on the part of the defeated, at least a well of creative activity, much of it perhaps an attempt to record the passions before the memory passes."" </p>

<p>On July 2, 1993, twenty-six years after Okigbo's death another news report that makes a reference to him appears in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>, ""The arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa"" by A.M Daniels. </p>

<p>Anthony Malcolm Daniels was born in 1949 and known by the pen name Theodore Dalrymple. He is an English cultural critic, prison doctor and psychiatrist, who worked in some Sub-Saharan African countries. Daniels has written extensively on culture, art, politics, education, and medicine – drawing on his experiences as a doctor and psychiatrist in Africa and the United Kingdom. His most notable works are: <em>Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass</em> (2001), <em>Our Culture, What's Left of It</em> (2005), <em>Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality</em> (2010). </p>

<p>Daniels' report summarizes the events that led to the arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa who is from the Niger Delta specifically Ogoniland, part of the seceding side, Biafra, during the Nigeria Civil war. Okigbo is mentioned when the reporter points out a connection with Saro-Wiwa, both men attended the same secondary school, Government College Umuahia, though they were hardly contemporaries—Saro-Wiwa being almost ten years younger than Okigbo. </p>

<p>However, Daniels writes that is where the similarities between both men end. Saro-Wiwa opposed the Biafran secession, ""…he saw an Ibo state as a worse threat to the safety and wellbeing of ethnic minorities within it than in a federal Nigerian state."" </p>

<p>It seems that whenever there is an unrest or protest in Nigeria being campaigned for by a writer or a reference to the Biafra war made in the media, the poet-soldier, Christopher Okigbo must make an appearance to provide a comparison, historical connection, or credibility to the new activist. These news reports or articles, however, reveal shallow and reductionist portraits of Okigbo, without any in depth reference to his writing or even to his history. In this sense, Okigbo the poet-soldier is a convenient symbol, though what exactly he symbolizes is never extremely clear in these reports. </p>

"recd3kSqMK5HlQj6K","apdp.commentary.000008","Ama Ata Aidoo in The Times between 1967 and 1997 ","<p>The first mention of Ghanaian writer, poet, and playwright Ama Ata Aidoo in The Times is in the PHS Diary column on October 1967, two years after her play <em>The Dilemma of a Ghost</em> was published. If a good title ought to capture the main idea of a text and even spark the interest of readers, then &ldquo;A Ghanaian Playwright&rdquo; certainly does not offer much in that regard. The news article introduces Aidoo as a Ghanaian playwright to &lsquo;the world.&rsquo;&nbsp;Born in 1945 in Abeadzi Kyia in the central region of Ghana, Aidoo attended the University of Ghana in Legon from 1961-1964. Following active participation in drama and writing workshops, she produced her first two plays and a collection of short stories. She would go on to explore Ghana&rsquo;s colonial history and its implications in her work as well as the cultural dynamics of neocolonialism. With her significant role in the Ghanaian literary scene and her mark as the first published African woman dramatist, it is crucial to observe how Aidoo was represented and her work recognized in the Western print media between 1967 and 1997, a time when ten of her books had been published, some to much acclaim.</p>
<p>The PHS Diary column begins thus: &ldquo;So far the only West African playwright we know much about is the Nigerian Wole Soyinka.&rdquo; The statement draws attention to the West&rsquo;s abysmal level of engagement with African theatre and recognizes Aidoo as one of the first female Ghanaian playwrights to be known beyond the continent, on the heels of Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka.&nbsp;By1967, Soyinka had produced over ten plays, often with a satirical influence, and was well known for being one of the foremost playwrights to put African theatre on a global stage.</p>
<p>Aidoo, however, is described as &ldquo;27, a short, good-natured Ghanaian writer.&rdquo; It is a description that highlights her demeanor and physical appearance in lieu of her talent and skill as a playwright, the occasion for which she&rsquo;s being featured in the newspaper. It is easy&nbsp;to wonder what other qualities of this new playwright should have been brought into focus and how a historicized and contextualized engagement with Aidoo&rsquo;s work could have altered readers&rsquo; perception of the playwright. The PHS Diary Column features a headshot of Aidoo, putting a face to the name, and shares some direct quotes from the interview, among which is one where Aidoo expresses the complexities&nbsp;of writing in English: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not accessible to the greater part of my people, but it also gives me the chance to reach a wider African and world audience. You feel like a fake&ndash;you suck your people dry for your materials and then dish it up for others.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is a candid and perhaps difficult statement to make, one wonders how differently these words would be interpreted once some context is provided. Since Ghana&rsquo;s independence in 1957, there&rsquo;s been no legislation to make Twi the official language of Ghana. Although presently Twi dominates Ghanaian arts and culture, English has been preserved for official business and as the language of instruction in schools, which is reflected in the attitudes toward the use of vernacular language: when one speaks English, they are regarded in higher esteem than one who speaks any of the fifty Indigenous languages. These linguistic complexities can be traced to the impact of colonialism. </p>
<p>Chinua Achebe aptly captures this condition in his 1965 essay, <em>English and the African Writer:</em></p>
<p>There are not many countries in Africa today where you could abolish the language of the erstwhile colonial powers and still retain the facility for mutual communication. Those African writers who have chosen to write in English or French are not unpatriotic smart alecs, with an eye on the main chance outside their countries. They are by-products of the same processes that made the new nation-states of Africa.</p>
<p>If readers had been provided with this historical framework, they could have engaged with the news article from a place of inquiry that acknowledges why Aidoo writes in English instead of a Ghanaian language and reflects on the cultural implications of her choice.</p>
<p>Considerable attention was given to Kathleen Wheeler&rsquo;s <em>Guide to Twentieth-Century Women Novelists (Guide) </em>in The Times Literary Supplement in 1997. Reviewing this reference book, critic Katy Emck describes Ama Ata Aidoo and South African writer Bessie Head as &ldquo;important Third World authors.&rdquo; It is worth pointing out how other women novelists in the <em>Guide</em> such as Elizabeth Hardwick, Dorothy Parker, and Susan Sontag are listed under &ldquo;[w]riters famous for their analytical and essayist work&rdquo; and how Edith Wharton and Virginia Woolf are upheld as &ldquo;canonical giants.&rdquo; The latter description emphasizes the writers&rsquo; prominence&nbsp;and reflects the notion that, unlike the African writer, American and European writers have worked their way up to earn high regard and should be represented as such. American and European authors are not identified by geographical markers nor by their country&rsquo;s economic and political status, but rather by the skills that distinguish their work as well as the recognition they and their accomplishments have enjoyed. The difference in categorizing writers is clear and it reveals the subtle ways in which racial arrogance and prejudice play a crucial part in the reception of African writers.&nbsp;</p>
<p> In&nbsp;her review of the <em>Guide</em>, Emck observes that the 135 entries on English-language authors showcase an &ldquo;uneven&rdquo; representation of the five continents by Wheeler. In the same vein, then, one may point out the unevenness in Wheeler&rsquo;s handling of the material, especially the African writers included in the <em>Guide</em>. Instead of clamoring for mere numerical balance, there is greater need to acknowledge and pay attention to the work of African writers&mdash;work that, over the years, has been significant in its depiction of cultural values and profound in its intellectual engagement with the conditions and traditions of the African continent. By the time of the <em>Guide</em>&rsquo;s publication in 1997, Aidoo had published most of her notable works including her first novel <em>Our Sister Killjoy</em> (1966), short story collection <em>No Sweetness Here</em> (1970), and novel <em>Changes</em>, which won the 1992 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book (Africa). Considering her engagement with Akan oral tradition and her critical work on feminist issues, colonialism, and postcolonialism, an introduction of this kind is woefully inadequate, and fails in illuminating both the writer and the quality of her work.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The theme of Pan Africanism is one Aidoo addresses in her work through her treatment of Black diasporic encounters as well as her examination of the political and cultural underpinnings of a traditional African society. In a 1968 The Times PHS Diary column, a small section is dedicated to the story &ldquo;Speak up about Soyinka.&rdquo; A year after the Nobel Laureate was placed in solitary confinement in August 1967 by the Gowon regime, Aidoo wrote to the Nigerian General &ldquo;asking him to break the silence&rdquo; on Soyinka&rsquo;s imprisonment. The news article carries a black and white photo of a young Wole Soyinka at a desk. Only three years after she received recognition for her play, <em>The Dilemma of a Ghost, </em>known for its significance in reflecting the Ghanaian culture and history, Aidoo is merely referred to as &ldquo;a Ghanaian playwright.&rdquo; She is quoted saying: &ldquo;I felt it should be written. People should not be allowed to forget Wole Soyinka&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo; There is very little context offered on Aidoo&rsquo;s relationship with Soyinka and on how a gesture of this kind reiterates her committed advocacy for political union and solidarity among African countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>James Moxon writes an article entitled &ldquo;Folklore Modern Style&rdquo; for The Times in 1969, in which he identifies Aidoo as one of several distinguished writers engaging Ghanaian oral tradition and folklore, key aspects of the country&rsquo;s cultural history and storytelling. In the article, Aidoo is recognized for combining music with folktale material successfully: in drawing on and inventing with elements of folk tradition, Aidoo nourishes her creations and demonstrates the sophisticated layers of African communication systems. Other African writers mentioned in the article are Efua Sutherland and Ayikwei Amrah. Moxon pays a great deal of attention to Sutherland&rsquo;s plays and collection of folktales due to the global attention her work has garnered. He notes how her dramatic plays have helped &ldquo;start a real revival in indigenous theater in Ghana.&rdquo; Moxon wraps up his argument with a note on the evolving nature of African oral history, including a brief mention of other authors whose works carry the structural and thematic relevance of such traditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Times articles on Ama Ata Aidoo from 1967 to 1997 mainly acknowledge her as a playwright and briefly examine her contributions as a contemporary African writer. Her poetry collections, including <em>Someone Talking to Sometime</em> (1986) and <em>An Angry Letter in January</em> (1992), received no coverage. Aidoo&rsquo;s novels and her writing in anthologies, however, were reviewed, receiving editorial credit, praise, and critique.   &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ama Ata Aidoo is the accomplished poet of four poetry collections: <em>Someone Talking to Sometime</em> (1985), <em>An Angry Letter in January and Other Poems</em> (1992), <em>Birds and Other Poems</em> (1993), and <em>After The Ceremonies: New and Selected Poems</em> (2017). Despite her prolific poetry career, she is primarily known and recognized for her novels and plays&mdash;<em>Changes: A Love Story, Our Sister Killjoy, </em>and<em> The Dilemma of a Ghost and Anowa </em>are only a few. In fact, so overshadowed are her poetic pursuits that over a thirty-five-year period&mdash;from 1965 to 2000&mdash;within three of the most established British news publications of the last century, her poetry goes largely unmentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ama Ata Aidoo is a Ghanaian poet born in Saltpond in 1940. After receiving her secondary school education at Wesley Girls, one of the most prestigious secondary schools in Ghana, she attended the University of Ghana, Legon where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English (Kumavie 58). She went on to write her first play, <em>The Dilemma of a Ghost</em>, in 1964 which was published by the British publishing house, Longman, thus beginning an extensive connection with the English literary scene similar to the one shared by many of her contemporaries who were published series such as the Heinemann African Writers.</p>
<p>In <em>The Sunday Times</em>, <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>,and the <em>Financial Times</em>, Aidoo is primarily represented in reviews, blurbs, and announcements about her novels and plays. In a review of <em>Unbecoming Daughters of an Empire</em> which appears in the <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> on April 9, 1993, Aidoo is described as a novelist. In a review of <em>The Development of African Drama </em>published on January 14, 1983, Aidoo is unsurprisingly portrayed as a playwright. In the twenty-nine times Aidoo appears in these publications, she is represented over a three-decade period as a prose writer and a playwright. The one mention of her poetry is still in the context of her novel. In a blurb of <em>Our Sister Killjoy</em>, appearing in an installment of <em>The Sunday Times</em> on May 22, 1988, the book&rsquo;s mixture of prose and poetry is referenced, but without any grounding background about her past poetic contributions.</p>
<p>The invisibility of Aidoo&rsquo;s poetry career can be credited to her establishment as a playwright and novelist prior to her release of any poetry collections. In 1964, as mentioned above, her first play, <em>The Dilemma of a Ghost</em>, was released. This was followed by her second play, Anowa, in 1970, and in the same year, her first prose contribution, <em>No Sweetness Here: A collection of Short Stories.</em> It wasn&rsquo;t until two decades into her literary career that she produced her first full-length collection of poetry. Despite what seems like an extensive time lag, Helen Yitah, author and Professor at University of Ghana, describes life as a poet as Aidoo&rsquo;s original ambition in the foreword to Aidoo&rsquo;s most recent collection, <em>After the Ceremonies</em> (x). &ldquo;Aidoo&rsquo;s poetry occupies an important place in her oeuvre because even though most of her poems were published after she had established herself as a writer&hellip; writing poetry was her childhood dream, and she wrote poems and won prizes for them before she began writing in other genres&rdquo; (x), Yitah writes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Similarly to her work in other genres, Aidoo&rsquo;s poetry explores a wide range of personal, cultural, and political commitments. Her poems engage with the immigrant experiences of people living in the West; nationalist, anti-imperialist, black consciousness, and female activist politics; and issues of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. A classic example of Aidoo&rsquo;s more political leanings can be found in her poem &ldquo;As the Dust Begins to Settle&rdquo; which offers a critique of capitalism and neoliberalism along with their embedded notions of privatization and divestiture (Aidoo 14). Her poem &ldquo;Fantse&rdquo; explores the immigrant longing for home (x). &ldquo;In For My Mother in Her Mid-90s,&rdquo;Aidoo offers a loving ode to her mother (6), getting in touch with her personal side. Across her poems, her commitment to women and feminism are also apparent. Aidoo, widely regarded as one of the pioneering women writers of her time, unfolds the issues and plight of women in her poems. </p>
<p>The absence of Aidoo&rsquo;s poetic achievements within the media documentation of her work naturally raises questions of consequence: what is at stake with this omission? In addition to the diminishing effect on her overall body of work and a holistic understanding of her as a writer, the absence of her poetry also has far-reaching implications for future generations of African poets. As one of only a few African writers of her time, Aidoo undoubtedly serves as a figure of representation, of inspiration. Through her achievements as a writer, others are more inclined to follow. Although there have been female African poets rising over the last few decades, writers such as Warsan Shire, Safia Ellhilo, Abena Busia, and Koleka Putuma, Aidoo still serves as one of the first examples of what is possible for African female poets. Through her, female African poets&mdash;and poets in general from the continent&mdash;know it is possible to not only achieve success from humble beginnings but to do so across genres. For this representation to be successful, however, the full extent of her work needs adequate visibility. As Ngugi wa Thiongo stated, Aidoo is &ldquo;a writer in the world and for the world&rdquo; and she is &ldquo;a writer for all seasons.&rdquo; Instead of restricting her to the labels of prose writer and playwright, she deserves to be recognized for the full scope of her oeuvre, both for her and the poets who come after her.</p>

<p>In the Wednesday, January 6, 2010 obituary of Dennis Vincent Brutus published in <em>The Times</em>, he is described as a renowned poet, anti-apartheid activist, and sportsman who played cricket and table tennis. Born of South African parents in then Salisbury, now Harare, in Zimbabwe on the 28<sup>th</sup> of November 1924, he died in Cape Town, South Africa on the 26<sup>th</sup> of December 2009. Brutus also wrote under the pseudonym John Bruin.</p>
<p><em>The Encyclopedia of World Biography</em> divides Brutus&rsquo;s poetry career into five phases with notable thematic and poetic shifts necessitated by the experiences and events that grounded his writing. But Brutus&rsquo;s stance on the apartheid government never changed; he consistently advocated for a South Africa free of racial discrimination and segregation. His first collection, <em>Siren, Knuckles, Boots </em>(1963) included lyrical yet complex poetry that conformed to English poetic traditions. When Brutus was imprisoned at Robben Island, his jail cell was beside Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s. It was while he was in prison for eighteen months, two of which were spent in solitary confinement, that he questioned his poetics and intended audience. His next book explores his prison experience. Brutus &ldquo;resolved thereafter to write simple, unornamented poetry that ordinary people could comprehend immediately.&rdquo; His second book, <em>Letters to Martha and Other Poems from a South African Prison</em> (1968), shows the second phase. It is genuine and speaks directly of the poet&rsquo;s intentions without any ambiguity. The collection &ldquo;is deliberately conversational and devoid of poetic devices.&rdquo; The beginning of the third phase was marked by his exile. After the completion of his jail term, the apartheid government gave him an &ldquo;exit pass&rdquo; which barred him from returning to his home country. His poetry of that period merged the simplicity and complexity of earlier works, and he wrote about homesickness and the beauty of South Africa in <em>Poems from Algiers</em> (1970), <em>Thoughts Abroad</em> (1970), and <em>A Simple Lust</em> (1973).</p>
<p>In 1973 Brutus traveled to China for a sports meeting and this trip afforded him the opportunity to explore Asian literature. He was &ldquo;impressed by the extreme economy of Chinese verse, [and] he began experimenting with epigrammatic poetic forms resembling Japanese haiku and Chinese ch&uuml;eh-ch&uuml;,&rdquo; which exemplified this fourth phase of his poetics as the collection <em>China Poems</em> (1975) demonstrates. In the final phase of his poetic development, Brutus's collections utilized a wide variety of poetic traditions. His poetry reflected a dynamism and surety of purpose. His work showed that he had settled into his style of self-expression and truth. He produced a range of collections that leaned on his experiences and showcased his creativity and skill.</p>
<p>Brutus was not only a prolific poet, he was also an anti-apartheid activist who successfully campaigned for the exclusion of South Africa from two Olympic games, Tokyo &lsquo;64 and Mexico &lsquo;68, and eventual expulsion from the Olympic Community in 1970. Poet and sportsman, Brutus used both of his passions to fight the apartheid government head-on. Brutus was the president of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that was formed to counter the ethos of only white South African sports associations and actively campaigned against discrimination in sports. Brutus as the President of SANROC leveraged this position and the importance of sports to apartheid South Africa by cutting its international sporting connections.</p>
<p>Below is a timeline of some of the protests spearheaded by Dennis Brutus as they appeared in <em>The Times</em> and <em>The Sunday Times:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Neil Allen. &ldquo;Anti-apartheid Sports Campaigner&rdquo; <em>The Times</em>. January 29<sup>th</sup>, 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allen describes Brutus as a &ldquo;quietly spoken schoolmaster and poet.&rdquo; Brutus, however, better reveals the personality that fuels his lifetime of activism when he says &ldquo;My nature is such I always start by being pessimistic. Then I begin to fight.&rdquo; On the effect that solitary confinement had on his mental health, Brutus declares &ldquo;Well, I did break in the sense that I twice tried to commit suicide with a razor blade. You reach an extraordinary state of mind.&rdquo; Brutus also gets into the core of his sports activism. He states, &ldquo;International contact in sport is vital to the white African South. But we in SANROC don&rsquo;t just fight against their status quo. We want a change of heart until South African sport is truly multi-racial in the Olympic spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>John Lovesey. &ldquo;The Great South African Sham&rdquo; <em>The Sunday Times</em>, April 14<sup>th</sup>, 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lovesay reports on the meeting of the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that was held in Lausanne to readmit South Africa into the Olympic games. However, IOC President Avery Brundage drags his feet on making a decision. Lovesay acknowledges the dilemma in which he finds himself, noting that &ldquo;[s]ome 46 countries have decided not to be in Mexico if South Africa is readmitted.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the position of the South African Olympic Committee is very clear. It maintains &ldquo;that it cannot promise the integrated sport in the foreseeable future&rdquo; and Frank Braun, President of the South African Olympic Committee, says &ldquo;his committee supported his government's policy.&rdquo; Also in discussion is the presence of Non-white South Africans at the cricket match where the Queen would be in attendance. Lovesey concludes the news report by mentioning that Brutus was an asylee in the United Kingdom and that, &ldquo;[i]t is to Britain&rsquo;s credit that [Brutus] is allowed to leave here. It is also to Britain&rsquo;s discredit that we do not support his cause.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Norman Fowler. &ldquo;New Immigration Loophole Feared&rdquo; <em>The Times.</em> July 6<sup>th</sup>, 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brutus&rsquo;s activism isn&rsquo;t limited only to the Olympics. As president of SANROC, he campaigns against the presence of Non-White South Africans at the Amateur Athletic Association championships where the Queen would be in attendance. To provide context to his complicated crusade against apartheid, Brutus states &ldquo;we feel we must protest against the presence of non-white athletes in South Africa who represent sports bodies affiliated to the racist South African sports organizations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dennis Brutus. &ldquo;If Arthur Ashe were African. . .&rdquo; <em>The Sunday Times.</em> July 7<sup>th</sup>, 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this opinion piece, Brutus attacks the racial discrimination of the South African Lawn Tennis Union (SALTU) which despite its affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) has rules that did not conform to those of its umbrella body. SALTU allows only white South Africans as members. Brutus challenges the discriminatory tendencies of SALTU and power dynamics at ILTF where the votes of member countries carry different weights, and the more powerful countries ignore the racial discrimination by SALTU. Brutus states &ldquo;[t]here may be some justification for the unequal distribution of voting power in terms of the varying organization strengths of nations where this will be to the advantage of tennis, but there can be no justification for the abuse of power when it is used in defence of racialism in sport.&rdquo; He concludes, &ldquo;[i]f Arthur Ashe lived in South Africa, he would not be chosen to play in the Davis Cup.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Neil Allen. &ldquo;The Real Tragedy is South Africa Itself&rdquo; <em>The Times.</em> September 18<sup>th</sup>, 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allen reports on South Africa&rsquo;s campaign to participate in the 1968 Olympics and the absurdity of the decision made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The executive board of the IOC decides South Africa will be excluded from the Mexican 1968 Olympics not due to racial discrimination in its sports, but because of &ldquo;the international climate&rdquo; and the rising discontent against South African policies from the international community. Allen also reports Prime Minister Vorster&rsquo;s remark that the exclusion of the South African cricket team from Test Cricket is tragic, but Allen counters this statement by quoting Allan Paton in his book, <em>Cry,</em> that &ldquo;it is not sports but the whole white South African philosophy which is tragic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allen confronts the British IOC's lackadaisical disposition, he states &ldquo;Lord Exeter, British Vice President of the International Olympic Committee, has often shown an excessively tolerant attitude towards the White South African Philosophy.&rdquo; Allen continues that the committee&rsquo;s representatives &ldquo;are aided in the myopic views by certain journalists who think that a jolly good game is all that matters, and they forget that the way the world lives is rather more important than the way it plays.&rdquo; After the successful expulsion of South Africa from Mexico&rsquo;s 1968 Olympics, Brutus' campaign garners international attention and solidarity from black people. Allen reports, &ldquo;Lord Exeter is &ldquo;worried about the young man up in California&mdash;by whom he meant Professor Harry Edwards, a militant American Negro, who has been trying to organize a boycott of the Olympics in protest at the lack of opportunity for those of his colour in the US.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Plan to Stop South African Matches&rdquo; <em>The Times.</em> September 11<sup>th</sup>, 1969.</li>
</ul>
<p>A coalition between SANROC, the Young Liberals church, and the Movement for Colonial Freedom aims to protest and push for the cancellation of the South African cricket team&rsquo;s tour of Britain and of an international rugby match between England and South Africa. Brutus, in his role as the coalition&rsquo;s chairman, proclaims &ldquo;We are fighting British collaboration with racialism in sport. We are confident of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dudley Doust. &ldquo;Nothing up South Africa's Sleeves&rdquo; <em>The Sunday Times</em>. May 17<sup>th</sup>, 1970.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doust provides an insider view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Amsterdam where South Africa defends its racial discrimination policies in sport. Doust describes both South Africa&rsquo;s arguments that anti-apartheid lobbyists shouldn&rsquo;t have been accepted by the IOC and their accusations that there were irregularities in the process when South Africa was ousted from the IOC in 1968 as &ldquo;arrogant.&rdquo; The Supreme Council of Sports in Africa sent two representatives to argue their case, Abraham Ordia from Nigeria and Jean-Claude Ganga from Congo Brazzaville. Ordia and Ganga argued the charge brought by Black African countries. They believed the expulsion of the South African Olympic committee is just because the country violates the number one rule of the Olympic Charter &ldquo;no discrimination is allowed against any person or country on grounds of race, religion and political affiliation.&rdquo; Ordia invited the South African IOC delegate to remain a part of the IOC Movement even though South Africa was out. He said &ldquo;if South Africa modifies their policies. They will be invited to the Pan African games in Lagos 1973.&rdquo; For Brutus the struggle continues, as he declares: &ldquo;Now we must get after Japan they have invited South Africa to play in their softball championship.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Neil Allen. &ldquo;Agony of Mind for Black Americans&rdquo; <em>The Times.</em> August 21<sup>st</sup>, 1972.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 1972, Brutus&rsquo; activism had morphed into a Pan-African movement with solidarity from Africans and Black Americans. Allen reports on the protests by athletes of African descent in the Munich Olympics of 1972. There is evidence of racism in sports in Rhodesia, so Brutus decides to protest its participation, but he changes his tactics. He states, &ldquo;we will have a successful Olympics&mdash;without Rhodesia.&rdquo; He promises that African countries will pull out of the Olympics if Rhodesia participates in the parade. Allen&rsquo;s reporting provides a close-up of the turmoil felt by African, Black British, and Black American athletes. The athletes know that this touted protest will be a watershed moment in the fight against racism in sports. The Olympics is the largest sports platform to make their stand known to the world and they did not want to be on the wrong side of history, but they had also prepared to compete at the games for years. Fortunately, the IOC moves in at the last moment and does not allow Rhodesia to take part in the games.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allen Neil. &ldquo;These Tarnished Olympics&rdquo; <em>The Sunday Times</em>. July 25<sup>th</sup>, 1976.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1976 Montreal Olympics will go down in history as one where African countries took matters into their own hands and made their demands known to the rest of the world that is reluctant to join their protest. In the words of Ganga, Supreme Council of African Sports representative, &ldquo;in our problems we are alone, we have to do this on our own. The African countries protested New Zealand&rsquo;s All Black tour of South Africa. New Zealand responded that &ldquo;their country does not mix politics with sports.&rdquo; Furthermore, Allen reports: &ldquo;Last week in Montreal [shows] just how much the African boycott decimated the Olympic Games was only too evident. In just two days, of the competition 1,000,000 Canadian dollars we're [sic] lost when events involving African countries had to be cancelled and seat money refunded.&rdquo; African countries failed to show up at basketball and boxing matches, track and field events, and long-distance running events. Brutus, ever the activist, declares, &ldquo;If they (African countries) are prepared to go through with this&mdash;which is more than we would ever ask&mdash;who are we to quarrel? We&rsquo;re with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brutus continued his fight against apartheid until its abolishment in 1990. He returned to South Africa in 1991 after teaching at the University of Denver, Northwestern University, and the University of Pittsburgh. He shifted the focus of his activism to the &ldquo;neoliberal policies of post-apartheid governments.&rdquo; He died at 85, and was survived by his wife, Mary Jaggers, and eight children.</p>

<p>The questions of what makes a poem a poem and what purpose it serves have been lingering subjects in the literary scene, especially when it comes to African poetry and how the West perceives it.</p>
<p>Ugandan poet Okot p&rsquo;Bitek in his many works draws attention to a poetic genre that, among others, deliberately relies on home-grown imagery, form, metaphor, and other poetic and linguistic devices in its construction. Okot&rsquo;s poems, such as <em>Song of Lawino </em>(1966), persist in scholarly and bonfire conversations, research, memories, and bookshelves for the effectiveness and uniqueness of their song form. However, the coverage of Okot&rsquo;s poetry collections by the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> in the 1970s points to the misreading and misrepresentation of the poet&rsquo;s songs, owing to their distinctness from Western poetic forms.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;In the Arms of the Prison,&rdquo; published on May 11, 1971, the article&rsquo;s unnamed critic declares Okot&rsquo;s <em>Song of Ocol</em> &ldquo;a disappointment,&rdquo; arguing that &ldquo;it savoured too much of a conscientious attempt to give a voice to an essentially dull, pompous, and vindictive husband.&rdquo; A little background to Okot&rsquo;s two songs could help contextualize why that is a misreading. <em>Song of Ocol</em> (1970) was Okot&rsquo;s follow-up poem to <em>Song of Lawino</em> (1966). In the first book, the persona of Lawino criticizes her husband Ocol&rsquo;s Westernized ways, shown in his various lifestyle choices, including marrying Clementine, a woman who talks and acts like a white person. Essentially, Okot critiques the follies of Western culture while upholding the Acoli/African culture that Lawino represents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversely, in <em>Song of Ocol</em>, the speaker, Ocol, criticizes African ways of life. He is so taken up by Western religion, medicine, politics, and lifestyle that he dreams and imitates them. He is so obsessed with work and keeping a timed schedule that he doesn&rsquo;t give audience to his friends or family&mdash;a very un-African behavior.</p>
<p>In <em>Song of Ocol</em>, Okot criticizes the influence of Western culture on Africa, including Africans who became oppressors of their own people when the white colonialists left. It is therefore very puzzling, albeit unsurprising, when the critic called <em>Song of Ocol</em> &ldquo;a disappointment&rdquo; for giving a voice to Ocol. The book couldn&rsquo;t exist without Ocol&rsquo;s character, just as <em>Song of Lawino</em> couldn&rsquo;t function without Lawino. </p>
<p>The critic fell into the pit of hating the character a writer creates, rather than focusing on and engaging with the issues that the questionable character represents. There&rsquo;s no denying that Ocol&rsquo;s character is arrogant, &ldquo;pompous,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;vindictive,&rdquo; as the critic describes, but those characteristics represent the foreign culture that Okot seeks to criticize. The book begins with Ocol dismissing his wife Lawino: &ldquo;Woman, shut up!&rdquo; he declares. He deems Lawino&rsquo;s complaints against his uncultured ways &ldquo;the mad bragging of a defeated general.&rdquo; Ocol is not open to a conversation with Lawino whom he considers below him intellectually and in other ways. &ldquo;Dull&rdquo; does not even come close to who Ocol is.</p>
<p>Therefore, the critic&rsquo;s disappointment in Ocol&rsquo;s character shows Okot&rsquo;s success in depicting a pervasive Western culture in post-independent Africa. The introduction of multiparty politics, its divisiveness and the self-serving attitude of politicians, are displayed through Ocol&rsquo;s character&mdash;all of which are reminiscent of the colonialists&rsquo; self-serving and divide-and-rule policy.</p>
<p>When Ocol despises Lawino for turning to African medicine and religion, Okot is making a point about the different ways in which the West labeled African religious and spiritual practices, as well as ways of healing, satanic. It&rsquo;s therefore mind-boggling why the critic found it befitting to label the book a disappointment.</p>
<p>A useful way of reviewing <em>Song of Ocol</em> is to regard the book as a partner of <em>Song of Lawino</em>. In the first song, Lawino laments Ocol&rsquo;s westernized ways and Ocol responds to Lawino in the second song about her &ldquo;backward&rdquo; African ways. While <em>Song of Ocol</em> doesn&rsquo;t stay loyal to Lawino as an addressee to Ocol&rsquo;s castigations, the themes in the book stay true to what Okot tackles in <em>Song of Lawino</em>. Therefore, to completely divorce Ocol from Lawino because the poet handled the characters in two different books is to invite a half understanding of the poet&rsquo;s works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another article, &ldquo;Songs from the grasslands,&rdquo; published on February 21, 1975 in the <em>Times Literary </em><em>Supplement,</em> writer Gerald Moore lays a deceptively flattering review of Okot&rsquo;s <em>Horn of My Love</em>. Quoting Okot&rsquo;s introduction to the book, Moore writes, &ldquo;Okot p'Bitek argues the case for African poetry as poetry, as an art to be enjoyed rather than as ethnographic material to be eviscerated.&rdquo; Moore adds that Okot&rsquo;s <em>Horn of My Love </em>together &ldquo;with Ulli Beier's valuable anthologies, can help to build up the stock of African poetry for enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore seems oblivious to Africa&rsquo;s unwritten poetry&mdash;the songs, chants, metaphors, sayings, and riddles of various literary traditions. In fact, Okot&rsquo;s <em>Horn of My Love</em> comprise actual Acoli dirges sung when death befalls a family. The collection lays out six themes that derive from the elegies. First, there&rsquo;s the disbelief in death:</p>
<p><em>I hear the horn of my love,</em></p>
<p><em>Oto Cura will soon come;</em></p>
<p><em>His horn sounded early in the morning;</em></p>
<p><em>But I search for him in vain&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>Who can spot the ostrich headgear of my love?</em></p>
<p>There are also songs about the ill person&rsquo;s &ldquo;battle with death,&rdquo; the cruelty of fate, songs that attack the dead, and the living, and those about surrendering to the reality of death.</p>
<p><em>Death burns the body of the woman</em></p>
<p><em>Like fire;</em></p>
<p><em>The woman cries with pain in her chest;</em></p>
<p><em>Beloved of my mother oh;</em></p>
<p><em>Death burns your body;</em></p>
<p><em>At last, today, it has taken you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Measuring &ldquo;the stock&rdquo; of Africa&rsquo;s <em>enjoyable </em>poetry through Okot&rsquo;s one book and anthologies by controversial German writer and translator Ulli Beier speaks to the narrowness Moore attached to his understanding of poetry. And while Beier is often credited for opening literary spaces in Nigeria and Papua New Guinea from the &lsquo;50s, he also notoriously masqueraded as a Nigerian and Papua New Guinean by writing under the name Obotunde Ijimere. One also wonders what Moore means by &ldquo;African poetry for enjoyment.&rdquo; At the end of the article, he seems to imply that <em>Horn of My Love</em> is enjoyable and nothing else. He writes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, however, it is a book of poetry to be handled and enjoyed, rather than a ponderous headstone placed on the living body of a popular art. It can be read with equal enjoyment, in these facing texts, by Acolis relishing the felicities of the original languages and by English readers relishing the muscularity of Okot p'Bitek's translations.</p>
<p>While this collection is derived from Acoli dirges, Okot did not merely render them in the English language. Translation is an art and the poems in this collection are still poetic&mdash;owing to Okot&rsquo;s mastery of the song form, but also to the fact that Acoli songs are indeed poems by themselves. Poetry, especially poetry from Africa, exists in many forms&mdash;forms that often collaborate with and borrow from other types of art. Limiting the understanding of African poetry to its written form, and reading African poetry through a western poetic lens is grossly disingenuous.</p>

<p>Depending on the source, Jeni Couzyn&rsquo;s nationality is a blend of three countries: she is a South African born in Johannesburg in 1942 or a Canadian of South African extract who is also British. Couzyn&rsquo;s bibliography shows the trajectory of her writing career and range. Her publications include poetry collections, <em>Flying</em> (1970), <em>Monkeys' Wedding</em> (1972), <em>Christmas in Africa</em> (1975), <em>The Happiness Bird</em> (1978), <em>House of Changes</em> (1978), <em>Life by Drowning: Selected Poems</em> (1985), <em>In the Skin House</em> (1993), <em>Homecoming</em> (1998), <em>A Time to be Born: Poems of Childbirth</em> (1999), <em>The Selected Poetry of Jeni Couzyn</em> (2000), <em>Creation of the World in /Xam Mythology</em> (2019), and children&rsquo;s books, <em>Bad Day</em> (1988), <em>Tom-Cat-Lion </em>(1987). Couzyn also edited three anthologies, <em>Twelve to Twelve: Poems Commissioned for Poetry D-Day</em> (1970), <em>The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets</em>: <em>Eleven British Writers</em> (1985) and <em>Singing Down the Bones</em> (1989).</p>
<p>By 1975, with three poetry collections under her belt, Couzyn was touted by Western critics as a well-established poet and was regularly featured on radio and TV programs on BBC and ITV. In <em>The Sunday Times</em> of February 9, 1975, John Howkins rounds up the radio and TV schedule for the day, noting Jeni Couzyn as the poet featured on the &ldquo;Far to Go&rdquo; show to discuss the future of poetry. When invited to &ldquo;Time for Verse,&rdquo; a show on BBC Radio 4 on February 5, 1981, Couzyn identifies the poets who influenced her work, mentioning Aphra Behn, Elizabeth Barrat Browning, Emily Dickinson, Christiana Rosetti, Anne Sexton, Kathleen Raine, and Stevie Smith. And in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> of November 29, 1985, &ldquo;The Index of Books Reviewed&rdquo; lists two of Couzyn&rsquo;s books: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodaxe_Books#Women_poets""><em>The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets</em></a>: <em>Eleven British writers</em> (1985) and <em>Life by Drowning: Selected Poems</em> (1985). They come in at #1370.</p>
<p>Couzyn&rsquo;s best known poetry collection, <em>Life by</em> <em>Drowning: Selected Poems </em>(1985), examines pregnancy and childbirth. It is well documented that when women write about motherhood and pregnancies, critics tend to reduce these important life events to hormones, hysteria, and depression while blatantly ignoring the work&rsquo;s depth and the writer&rsquo;s creativity. Reviews of Couzyn&rsquo;s work in <em>The Times</em>, <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> and <em>The Sunday Times</em> consistently show this patriarchal and misogynistic trend. </p>
<p>Some male critics show their bigotry when they encounter the work of female poets in their lack of openness to experiencing or reading about the lives of women. In <em>The Sunday Times</em> review of May 16, 1971, titled &ldquo;Lyman Andrews Selects the Best from the Little Presses,&rdquo; Andrews reviews the poetry collections of four young poets of which Couzyn is the only woman. Of Couzyn&rsquo;s <em>Flying</em> (1970) published by Workshop Press he wrote, &ldquo;[it] leaves me with feelings. A rather specious note of hysteria sometimes weakens her verse, but I like her bitter and black humour (&ldquo;Preparation of Human Pie&rdquo; is the woman&rsquo;s page run by women&rsquo;s Lib). There is no doubt in my mind that Miss Couzyn already shows her own poetic individuality and will be a name to watch.&rdquo; Andrews&rsquo;s take is a shallow interpretation that disrespects Couzyn&rsquo;s talents and contributions to poetry.</p>
<p>In an April 2, 1972 TV schedule report titled &ldquo;Action in Memphis and Islington,&rdquo; <em>The Sunday Times</em> reviews three protest films, &ldquo;King&mdash;Montgomery to Memphis,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ours Whatever They Say,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clouds of Witness,&rdquo; all of which are based on real-life events. The report describes &ldquo;It is Ours Whatever They Say&rdquo; as a film about a group of mothers and their children in Islington who fought their local council for the wasteland that they wanted to repurpose into a playground from becoming a car park. <em>The Sunday Times</em> report describes Couzyn&rsquo;s contribution to the film, its prologue and epilogue, as &ldquo;apt and beautiful&rdquo; but refers to her, then a thirty-year-old woman who had published two poetry collections with a third on the way, as &ldquo;&hellip;the young poet Jeni Couzyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another reviewer continues the devaluation of Couzyn&rsquo;s work and infantilization of her person. Michael Hofmann in his 1985 article in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> titled &ldquo;Hopes and Resentments&rdquo; reviews titles by two women poets, Jeni Couzyn and Carol Rumen, focusing on Couzyn&rsquo;s edited volume <em>The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets</em>: <em>Eleven British Writers </em>(1985) and her poetry collection <em>Life by Drowning: Selected Poems</em> (1985). Hofmann does a disservice to Couzyn and Rumen by centering male poets in his review instead of focusing on the craft and themes of the books under study. Early on, Hofmann reveals his bias by roasting the anthology&rsquo;s title, stating that the age range of the women poets in the collection is &ldquo;[o]ver forty and possibly dead.&rdquo; Hofmann goes on further to disparage the poets&rsquo; voices, writing that &ldquo;[t]he poems of the eleven English women included here move resignedly in an area of dry hurt, deploying a characteristically tart and spry tone&hellip;&rdquo; In nearly half of his review focuses on the supposed preoccupation of these female poets which he deduces to be handwringing and manhating.</p>
<p>After describing Couzyn&rsquo;s foreword as a &ldquo;fighting introduction,&rdquo; he writes:</p>
<p>Jeni Couzyn and many of her contributors give short shrift to men: men have used to their power as sole arbiters of poetic taste to silence and ignore and misrepresent women poets, driving them to despair and even their death; and they have set up their own false gods of &ldquo;cleverness&rdquo; and &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in poetry, which in their hands have become dry and without magic.</p>
<p>Couzyn&rsquo;s editorship doesn&rsquo;t escape Hofmann&rsquo;s bigoted pen either, he states that &ldquo;[t]he emphasis of Jeni Couzyn&rsquo;s editorship though, tends to be on the obstacle, and it gives her anthology a pent-up and resentful quality from which too few of the poems manage to liberate themselves.&rdquo; Hofmann dismisses Couzyn&rsquo;s feminist lens and editorial curation because of the poets&rsquo; vulnerability and the topics explored. The poems do not fit his definition of the quality and themes the women should interrogate. Hofmann also mocks Denise Levertov&rsquo;s [a contributor] self-assertion: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose my gender to be an obstacle to anything I really wanted to do.&rdquo; Hoffman declares that Levertov&rsquo;s poetry &ldquo;blends a classic prose with a modern (though it&rsquo;s not always self-evident here) self-assurance&hellip;.&rdquo; Hofmann belittles Levertov&rsquo;s admission but lauds one of her poems &ldquo;A Tree Telling of Orpheus&rdquo; as &ldquo;The best poem in the book&rdquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t touch on &ldquo;any feminist subject.&rdquo; Hofmann in a demeaning tone finally uses the word feminism to show his hatred for the feminist theme of the collection.</p>
<p>Almost reluctantly, Hofmann points out the only &ldquo;good&rdquo; thing he sees in the anthology: &ldquo;The book&rsquo;s prose really catches the good eye: one would have to go through a good many men poets before finding such uncluttered and unembarrassed accounts of themselves and their work as provided here [by women contributors] &hellip;&rdquo; By prose he refers to the personal introductions to their poems by the women poets. He elevates their prose over their poetry and lauds their openness and honesty only because men poets would not have been able to do be write truthfully about themselves.</p>
<p>Of Couzyn&rsquo;s poetry collection, Hofmann had this to say: &ldquo;It is only in the title sequence, the diary of her pregnancy that the book acquires patience, understanding and a more credible simplicity&hellip;. These qualities come out still more strongly and promisingly in the poems about her friend&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; It is in Couzyn&rsquo;s interrogation of life and death that Hofmann acknowledges some degree of creativity, which he still qualifies with &ldquo;promisingly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Often, presentism may impede the critical interrogation of dated texts, but not in this case, as I cross-examine Hofmannn&rsquo;s review with a similarly dated text to allow for a balanced view and context. Maggie Gee, in a short opinion piece in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> dated December 13, 1985 and titled &ldquo;Women Poets 1985,&rdquo; responds to Hofmann&rsquo;s and other critics&rsquo; skewed reviews of female poets. Gee declares, &ldquo;We told that Carol Rumen&rsquo;s book &lsquo;promises much of the future&rsquo; and that Jeni Couzyn&rsquo;s qualities show &lsquo;promisingly&rsquo;.&rdquo; Yet both are over forty, and respectively on their fourth and sixth solo books. It has been long since say Craig Raine or James Fenton was promising. Women poets have other youthful attributes.&rdquo; Gee further comments on the childish characteristics critics ascribe to female poets, noting that &ldquo;[t]he first adjectives Mr. Hofmann attaches to the poems he reviews are &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaging&rdquo; as if they are the work of children.&rdquo; As to Hofmann&rsquo;s diatribe on women writing about their anger and frustrations, Gee states, &ldquo;[i]t seems to upset male critics when women are disagreeable and show what Mr. Hofmann calls &ldquo;resentment&rdquo;. Yet women writers have cause for anger. The world of letters will not even begin to be &ldquo;postfeminist&rdquo; until women and men are seen to grow up at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &lsquo;women&rsquo;s themes&rsquo; are deemed not literary enough or too emotional by some critics creates a situation where some women writers shy away from said themes because they want to be regarded as &lsquo;serious&rsquo; writers. Editor and journalist, Sally Emerson, states in her 2009 <em>The Sunday Times </em>article &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get Down to Birth: The Topic of Babies has Male Publishers Mewling and Puking,&rdquo; that &ldquo;women still, after all these years, seem afraid of seeming sentimental or gushing about their children. Too&hellip;er&hellip;female. As though there is something acutely embarrassing about being female.&rdquo; Emerson also remarks that &ldquo;[w]omen are happy to write about how difficult it all is, about sleepless nights and depression&mdash;which men would assume to be the case&mdash;but, except in poetry, not about the joy, because that is sentimental and female and not at all male.&rdquo; Yet, women are writing about their experiences even though publishing often exoticizes the parenting experiences of men over women&rsquo;s. Of Couzyn and the other women poets, including Carol Ann Duffy and Sylvia Plath who wrote about childbirth and their children, Emerson says, &ldquo;Perhaps this is the beginning of a proper understanding and respect for this realm of women&rsquo;s power.&rdquo; Women poets continue to write about these important life events and experiences even though they are deemed ordinary by critics. Their creativity should not be deemed mundane because they write about pregnancy, childbirth and their children. And their resolve continues to shift the conversation about feminism, their bodies, and children.</p>
<p>Couzyn&rsquo;s body of work counters the expectations and biases of male critics. Her poetry explores the world through diverse geographies she experienced, South Africa, Canada, and United Kingdom, and human experiences. She brings to readers poetry about childbirth, pregnancy, and many other important topics that will continue to ruffle to the feathers of sexist critics. </p>

","<p>Kwesi Brew's Ideology Misinterpreted</p>
<p>Kwesi Brew (1928 &ndash; 2007) was among the first batch of graduates from the university college of Gold Coast (now the university of Ghana) in 1951. Right from his school days, Kwesi developed a keen interest in poetry writing. It was, therefore, not surprising that his collection of poetry won the British Council poetry competition in Accra and that his poems later appeared in <em>Okyeame</em>, a Ghanaian literary journal, among other notable anthologies. Between 1968 and 1996, Kwesi Brew published four collections of poetry: <em>The Clan</em> <em>of the Leopard</em> <em>and other poems</em> (1996), <em>Return of no return and other poems</em> (1995), <em>African Panorama and other poems</em> (1981), and <em>Shadows of Laughter</em> (1968) (Persoon et al. 1).</p>
<p>Kwesi Brew came of age and lived through one of the most important eras in Ghana&rsquo;s history and yet, he is &ldquo;practically unknown to Westerners&rdquo; (Persoon et al. 42). His contemporaries were Kofi Awoonor, Atokwei Okai, Chinua Achebe, Christopher Okigbo, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, and Wole Soyinka, among others. Interestingly, <em>The Times Literary Supplement </em>of July 4, 1969 describes Kwesi Brew as &ldquo;Ghana&rsquo;s leading Poet&rdquo; and yet, he gets mentioned only four times: August 1963, September 1965, July 1969, and August 1969. If &lsquo;Ghana&rsquo;s leading poet&rsquo; gets mentioned only four times in seven years, then one wonders what publicity unsung or non-leading poets will attract. Persoon et al. lament that, except for a few anthologies, at the time of Kwesi Brew&rsquo;s death in 2007, none of his four collections of poems was in print (3). This was the case because Brew was not given the recognition due to him.</p>
<p>Comparing him to Wole Soyinka, J.P. Clark, Gabriel Okara, and Christopher Okigbo, Gerald Holyoake Moore and Gerald More in ""Paths to Refinement&rdquo; assert that four poems by Kwesi Brew &ldquo;rise above the level of chronic Mediocrity&rdquo; (page number). Interestingly, Moore et al. indicate that in 1963, &ldquo;Kwesi Brew found his path.... by breaking away from Western models.&rdquo; However, in the succeeding paragraphs, Moore et al. describe the poetry of Kwesi Brew as lacking the &ldquo;passionate concentration which stamps many of Mr. Echeruo's images.&rdquo; Before analyzing the substance of that statement, who in the first place is Michael J. C. Echeruo and on what grounds is he compared with Kwesi Brew?</p>
<p>Michael Joseph Chukwudaalu Echeruo attended the university college of Ibadan and later earned his master&rsquo;s and Ph.D at Cornell University, in Ithaca, USA. Echeruo was a contemporary of Christopher Okigbo and specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobian drama. The Bible, D.H. Lawrence, Joyce, and many Western models were among the sources of his inspiration. Present in all of Echeruo&rsquo;s poems is a trait of constant lyricism. Azuonye Chukwuma describes Echeruo as one of the &ldquo;most powerful voices among the first generation of post-independent African poets of English expression&rdquo; (1).</p>
<p>These two poets, Kwesi Brew and Michael Echeruo, were each unique in their ways. Echeruo found his voice by breaking away from African models whereas Brew&rsquo;s uniqueness stemmed from breaking &ldquo;away from the Homiletic tone,&rdquo; which was &ldquo;much influenced by hymns and tracts which predominated Ghanaian poetry before 1960&rdquo; (Holyoake et al. replace this with a page number). Moore et al. add that the poetry of Kwesi Brew was distinct because he ignored &ldquo;Western models&rdquo; and &ldquo;largely&rdquo; adhered to the &ldquo;structure and imagery of Akan traditional songs of praise and prayer&rdquo; (page number).</p>
<p>The explanation above reveals a sharp contrast between the writing style of Echeruo and Brew, while Echeruo wrote mostly on the bedrock of Western models, Brew relied on the models of Akan praise songs and prayer. If Moore et al. argue that the antecedents of Brew&rsquo;s poetry deny it depth, creativity, and scholarship, then, that is quite unfortunate. Such deficient commentaries and reviews from Western critics inform the thesis of Onwuchewka et al. <em>Towards the Decolonisation of African Literature </em>who described the poetry of Echeruo and his contemporaries, Okigbo and Soyinka, as being &ldquo;craggy, lumpy, full of obstructions, unnecessary and artificially difficult&rdquo; where &ldquo;simple ideas are deliberately clothed in esoteric idioms&rdquo; (29). The essence of this essay is not in any way to berate the works of Echeruo, who is a great and accomplished poet in his own right; the point, however, is that Moore et al.&rsquo;s attempt to disregard Brew&rsquo;s African and Akan worldview and knowledge systems is unnecessary, redundant and must be ignored by all well-meaning scholars.</p>
<p>Besides, what do Moore et al. mean by &ldquo;passionate concentration&rdquo;? By this, they refer to Echuruo&rsquo;s use of sophisticated language and imagery. It needs to be pointed out that Brew, just like Echeruo, initially wrote his poetry following the ideals of Western models. To illustrate further, from Brew&rsquo;s first collection of poetry, titled &ldquo;Hot day&rdquo;, critics should be able to find several examples of &ldquo;passionate concentration&rdquo;:</p>
<p>The sheep lie spread in mid-day slumbers</p>
<p>&nbsp;And drizzling heat encumbers</p>
<p>&nbsp;The motion of the clouds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;No cloud moves, no wind shouts</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the mumbling noon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Molten heat shivers in the space,</p>
<p>The white egrets make pace,</p>
<p>&nbsp;The purple starlings sing:</p>
<p>Their shoulders roll, their cries ring</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the mumbling noon.</p>
<p>The rhythm, rhyme scheme, and imagery of &ldquo;Hot day&rdquo; are molded on the ideals of Wordsworth (Persoon et al. 45). Perhaps the tight imagery and elevated language, the AABC rhyme and others are what Moore et al. describe as being &lsquo;passionate concentration.&rsquo; However, being misunderstood might not be the aim of Kwesi Brew; therefore, from such models, which were Western in outlook, style, and content, Kwesi Brew shifted to writing poetry in the language and imagery best understood by his people who were second-language learners of the English language, among whom Western education was just taking root. This shift from using Western models to using African imagery and words was deliberate. Kwesi wanted to communicate and write poems to the appreciation of his kin and not to the enjoyment of Westerners (May et al. 1965). And to do that, his language, imagery, and symbolism had to appeal to his primary audience. In fact, from the Western ideals or models, Kwesi shifted to fellow African poets such as Michel Die-Anang, Awoonor, Mortty, Ademola, Angelou, Sutherland, and de- Graft (Persoon 45). It is worth noting that even his publishing also followed a similar move from Western to African publishers. His first and second books were published in England and America, respectively, but his third and four books were published in Ghana, in 1995and 1996. This shift reinforces a deliberate ideology, thought and outlook in the activities of Kwesi Brew, marking him off as a truly pan-African scholar worth celebrating.</p>

<p>Oswald Joseph Mbuyiseni Mtshali, a South African poet born in 1940, gained world renown when his first collection of poetry, titled <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em>, was published in 1971 by Oxford University Press, and later reprinted by Third Press in America in 1972. This collection won the Olive Schreiner Prize in 1974. Oswald revealed in an interview with Ursula A. Barnett that &ldquo;the impetus from his teachers at school&rdquo; and encouragement from his friend, Lionel Abrahams, a South African poet, inspired him to continue writing and get published.</p>
<p>Hugo Young, in a review titled &ldquo;Stranger&rsquo;s Voice&rdquo; that was published in the May 6, 1973, edition of <em>The</em> <em>Sunday Times</em>, asserts that Mtshali&rsquo;s work was inspired by lamentations in the newspapers of the absence of African poets. Hugo&rsquo;s unfounded assumption is confounding because, before Mtshali, there were several African poets of commendable repute. Besides, whoever lamented this &lsquo;absence&rsquo; of poets, and what ever newspaper it was, is not stated, so it beats my imagination as a scholar to think that a review published in an acclaimed newspaper as <em>The</em> <em>Sunday Times</em> could make such a strong assertion without any evidence and yet get published. In their review published in <em>The Times Literary Supplement,</em> Muriel Bradbrook and Guy Butler indicate that in 1968 Penguin published a book of South African verses which contained &ldquo;over fifty poems by Africans.&rdquo; In addition, Bradbrook and Butler explain that in 1967 Nadine Gordimer and Lionel Abrahams also released a publication titled <em>South African Writing</em> <em>Today</em> which has works by nine Black authors. These included but were not limited to Wole Soyinka, Ousmane Sembene, Kofi Awonoor, and Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o among others. The existence of these books, therefore, raises doubt about Hugo&rsquo;s assumptions about the absence of African poets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum </em>was published to international acclaim and recognition. Mtshali&rsquo;s fame was such that in 1973, he, a Black South African, performed at the Poetry International program held annually in London. We should not lose sight of the period in which he was invited to perform; his country was under apartheid, with severe restrictions on Black South Africans, and yet, Mtshali had the privilege to travel and perform at an international program in England. We can only imagine the protocols that were broken to pave a way for him because of his immense talent.</p>
<p>After considering the sales generated after the release of <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em>, Frank Norman in a review considered the work to be &ldquo;a runaway best-seller among both black and white readers,&rdquo; and Mtshali became one of the pacesetters not only for future South African poets but also poets the world over. Again, at the 1973 Poetry International program, Mtshali performed alongside internationally acclaimed poets such as W.H. Auden and Allen Ginsberg, both from the USA, among others, at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. This feat reiterates his ingenuity and commitment to the craft.It is quite rare for anyone to achieve overnight success, especially from Mtshali&rsquo;s background, without much toil and dedication.</p>
<p>In the foreword to <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em>, Nadine Gordimer writes that &ldquo;the world you will enter through these poems is a black man&rsquo;s world made by white men.&rdquo; Her focus is on the poetry and poetics of the collection. Gordimer&rsquo;s critique sharply contrasts Hugo&rsquo;s review in which he remarks that &ldquo;if a South African, therefore, sells 16,000 copies of his first book of poems, it suggests there is either something remarkable about the poet or something peculiarly receptive about the time in which he writes.&rdquo; Unfortunately, Hugo does not focus on the literary techniques embedded in the poems or ascribe the collection&rsquo;s fame to the quality of the work. His assertion alludes to the fact that Oswald's fame is attributed to providence and not based on hard work or the creative dexterity at play in writing the poems. Additionally, Dennis Walder&rsquo;s 1985 critique of Mtshali&rsquo;s <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em><em>,</em> titled &ldquo;Quiet and disquiet&rdquo; and published in <em>The Times Literary</em> <em>Supplement</em> is similar to Hugo&rsquo;s, in that he claims that Msthali &ldquo;established his reputation overnight.&rdquo; Such claims downplay the creative consistency at play in Mtshali&rsquo;s work. Mtshali&rsquo;s achievements may be everything but not &lsquo;overnight&rsquo; as Walder seems to suggest.</p>
<p>Western critics and scholars often ascribe the fame and success African writers achieve to anything but hard work and talent. With Eurocentric lenses, they critique African texts as underdeveloped and lacking merit and critical scholarship. Reviews like Hugo&rsquo;s may have tried to overtly downplay the artistry exhibited by Mtshali, but the success of his publication points otherwise. Besides, one must not lose sight of the fact that Mtshali&rsquo;s success was achieved during apartheid, a period when the humanity, intelligence, and achievements of Black South Africans were erased.</p>
<p>Mtshali&rsquo;s next major work <em>Fireflames</em> (1980) dedicated to the &ldquo;brave school children of Soweto&rdquo; was banned (Walder 1885, 527). In a comparative review of three south African poets, Patrick Cullinan, Douglas Livingstone, and Oswald Mtshali, titled &ldquo;Quiet and Disquiet,&rdquo; Dennis Walder focuses on the merits of Patrick and Douglas&rsquo; poetry but makes a sharp U-turn in Mtshali&rsquo;s instance, and hammers on the weakness in Mtshali&rsquo;s <em>Fireflames.</em> Walder claims that this weakness led to its banning, and that <em>Fireflames</em> attacked the government and made racist pronouncements. In as much as critical studies may try to overlook &lsquo;colour tags&rsquo; or better still &lsquo;race&rsquo;, it must be asked, under what circumstances does a review of three poets focus on the strength of the first two, both white, and on the weakness of the last one, who happens to be black?</p>
<p>Dennis further explains that the banning of Mthali&rsquo;s second volume suggests &rdquo;a talent misused in the service of laudable aims.&rdquo; Mtshali&rsquo;s second volume was banned due to censorship rules by the apartheid government. Just like <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em>, this second volume aimed at bringing to the fore the plights, fears, and insecurities of the youth in Soweto. If this constituted a &lsquo;talent misused&rsquo; then we may have to redefine what art is supposed to achieve. African writers such as Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, Ayi Kwei Armah, Wole Soyinka, and others faced years of persecution and even incarceration due to governmental censorship and disapproval of their works. The apartheid government allowed only the circulation of books that dulled or did not tickle the intelligence of the indigenous South Africans. What, if may we ask, is the role or duty of the educated Black South African if not to rouse the consciousness of the masses to self-worth? Besides, like the members of the negritude movement and the various cultural nationalists in Ghana and Nigeria, what precisely was the poet&rsquo;s duty if not to air, document, and make known to the rest of the world the plight of their people?</p>
<p>Walder adds that Mtshali aligned himself with the &ldquo;changing consciousness of his people&rdquo; and this led Mtshali to abandon &ldquo;the quieter, ironic mode of his earlier work (that is, <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em>) for rhetorical expostulation.&rdquo; Describing <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em> as quieter and ironic leaves a lot to be desired because the text achieved unprecedented fame both at home and abroad. Walder&rsquo;s review presents a juxtaposition of two critical positions; the first is the acceptance of a &lsquo;quieter&rsquo; volume vis-a-vis the rejection of the one described as presenting a &ldquo;rhetorical expostulation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of all the reviews on Mtshali&rsquo;s work, only Norman&rsquo;s review titled <em>&ldquo;</em>African Honeymoon&rdquo; published in <em>The Sunday Times </em>describes <em>Sounds of Cowhide Drum</em> as &ldquo;lyrical and powerfully composed. A cry of anguish for the plight of the black man in South Africa &hellip; often devastatingly critical of the Vorster regime.&rdquo; As has been said, until the lion learns to tell his own story, tales of hunting would always glorify the hunter. Africans creating platforms and avenues for critiquing African works is the way forward and this is amply displayed in the<em> African Honeymoon. </em></p>

"recNRgoYmzNMUO0Lg","apdp.commentary.000015","The 1985 Execution of Benjamin Moloise in The Times and The Sunday Times","<p>The 1985 Execution of Benjamin Moloise in <em>The Times</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Sunday Times</em></p>
<p>Poet and political activist Benjamin Moloise&rsquo;s execution on October 18, 1985 stirred an uproar that sent people in South Africa onto the streets in a charged protest, with the outcry ""Blood of Moloise!"" Moloise was hanged at Pretoria Central Prison by the apartheid South African government for his alleged involvement in the murder of a Black security policeman, Phillipus Selepe. There was some coverage of events leading to this execution in the newspapers, including two reports by Ray Kennedy in <em>The Times</em>, titled &ldquo;The pressures mount on Pretoria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pretoria judge delays hanging&rdquo; subtitled &ldquo;ANC Plea on Black&rsquo;s Execution&rdquo;. In the first article published on August 20<sup>th</sup>, 1985, Kennedy writes about the appeal made to the South African president at the time, Pieter Botha, &ldquo;to reprieve a Black man due to be hanged.&rdquo; In the second paragraph, the man is identified as simply thirty-year-old Benjamin Moloise and Kennedy gives no reference to his work as a poet, his membership in the banned African National Congress (ANC), nor to his contributions to the liberation movement and opposition to apartheid.</p>
<p>In the second article, released one day after the first publication, Kennedy describes Benjamin Moloise as a &lsquo;poet and upholsterer&rsquo; and notes matter-of-factly that he was to be hanged &ldquo;for the murder of a black security policeman.&rdquo; The rest of the story centers on the judicial process and shares Moloise&rsquo;s lawyer&rsquo;s move to present fresh evidence to the Pretoria Supreme Court. There is not much written about Moloise&mdash;his political activism or his poems--</p>
<p>nor about the nature of his alleged involvement in killing the officer. Even in this second report, there is still some distance from the personhood of Moloise and his artistic expression. It is unclear what could be the cause of this lack of representation. Moloise&rsquo;s name and execution aroused national unrest and global attention.&nbsp;One could argue that following the news of his death, Moloise&rsquo;s name and execution shined some light on his poetry and activism as well.</p>
<p>Moloise, whose poetry was known for its critique of the oppressive South African apartheid regime, inscribed many poems on the walls of his cell when he was on death row, with one line ending &ldquo;The storm of oppression will be followed by the rain of my blood&hellip;I am proud to give my life, my solitary life.&rdquo; This detail came to be known when his mother, Pauline Moloise, produced the poems, saying &ldquo;I am very proud. I never thought one day I would have a warrior in my arms.&rdquo; In <em>The</em> <em>Times </em>news article published on October 18, 1985, &ldquo;Black poet defiant in face of death,&rdquo; Ray Kennedy includes this moment in his article as he considers the mother&rsquo;s interaction with her son during her prison visit. His choice of &lsquo;defiance&rsquo; to describe Moloise&rsquo;s response is interesting. When Kennedy writes that &ldquo; [Moloise] had no regrets about his involvement with the ANC,&rdquo; he notes Moloise&rsquo;s stance to continue his activism and refusal to back down in the face of persecution. The news article highlights the poet&rsquo;s resistance and vision for an apartheid-free government. The excerpt of the poetry on the walls of his cell alludes to his activism and vision, as well as reveals his determination and bravery in the face of trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 19, 1985, a third article by Ray Kennedy was published in <em>The Times</em>: &ldquo;Thousands Riot after Pretoria Poet is executed.&rdquo; The featured picture shows Moloise&rsquo;s mother with her hand raised in a &ldquo;black power salute.&rdquo; There is no image of Moloise himself. The execution of Benjamin Moloise &ldquo;drew protests and condemnation from around the world, especially in central Johannesburg.&rdquo; In the articles mentioned earlier in this essay, Moloise was referred to as a &lsquo;black poet&rsquo; and while this description continues in the other news articles, this headline following his execution is one worth noting:he goes from being a black poet to a &lsquo;Pretoria poet.&rsquo; There is a specificity to this labeling, a description that ties him to South Africa and the African continent. There seems to be an impulse to separate the violence and unrest of that moment in Africa, particularly, Pretoria, from that of the world. This specificity could be read to dissociate and create a clear divide between a black poet and a Pretoria poet whose execution leads to turmoil. Notwithstanding, Moloise&rsquo;s poetic voice was fierce and proved to be a useful tool in rallying people to speak against leadership failures, violence, and oppression in South Africa. Through his writing and activism, he resisted silence and displayed an unwavering commitment to the fight for freedom and the call against segregationist policies.</p>
<p>Two days after Moloise&rsquo;s death, Maurice Chittenden and Eric Marsden write the article &ldquo;Police Hold 280 after Apartheid Sit-down&rdquo; for <em>The Sunday Times </em>featuring a black and white image of the police restraining two young men. The caption reads: &ldquo;Strife in two cities: Police arrest demonstrators after Friday&rsquo;s Johannesburg riots and yesterday&rsquo;s London protest<em>.&rdquo; </em>The article reports the arrest of demonstrators in London who called on leaders to impose sanctions on South Africa for carrying out Moloise&rsquo;s execution. Again, Moloise is referred to as a poet, although no attention is given to his work. A key observation is how several of these newspapers centered their coverage on the incidents surrounding the man, his execution, and its aftermath, and hardly about the man himself, his political activism, and especially not his poetry, although this is how he is identified in their headlines and the text. That said, it is important to acknowledge that a compilation of his poems was not readily available until 1990 and that perhaps the lack of it was largely due to issues of accessibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these reports failed to emphasize the poet&rsquo;s activism and the role his art played in his political engagements. The execution of South African activist and poet Benjamin Moloise drew the attention of the Soviet Union, the European Community, and the U.N. Security Council, and set off an unprecedented reaction from the people of Johannesburg as they fought back white authorities, putting their own lives at risk, an act that echoes the poet&rsquo;s words and unrelenting allegiance: &ldquo;The storm of oppression will be followed/ By the rain of my blood/ I am proud to give my life/ My one solitary life.""</p>

"recFDqRRKad83L8aJ","apdp.commentary.000016","On impolite literature: The portrayal of Taban Lo Liyong in Times Literary Supplement and The Sunday Times, 1970-1976","<p>Subversive literature, and works that fall within the realm of impoliteness, have always been a contentious undertaking.The backlash for such works could be intense. For the rubble-rousing writer, questions will arise about their intellect, the quality of their work as a whole, and whether they are indeed concerned about the subject they're scrutinizing or simply seeking to gain literary capital. South Sudanesepoet, critic, and academic Taban Lo Liyong is one such writer.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the East African literary scene, or even that of Uganda where the writer grew up, would have come across his ouvre of political commentaries and creative work that span 20 books, and include eight poetry collections such as <em>The Cows of Shambat</em> (1992), <em>Words that Melt a Mountain</em> (1996), <em>Carrying Knowledge Up a Palm Tree</em> (1997), <em>Corpse Lovers and Corpse Haters</em> (2005), and <em>After Troy </em>(2o21). In 2001, Lo Liyong translated Wer Per Lawino (<em>The Defence of Lawino</em>), a poetry collection by the acclaimed Ugandan writer Okot p'Bitek. </p>
<p>From the 1960s, Lo Liyong established himself as a criticof the post-colonial education system, self-serving politicians, and the exploitative influence of the West on Africa. Perhaps the most controversial of his critical works at the time was a paper he wrotetogether with Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Henry Owuor-Anyumba. Titled ""On the Abolition of the English Department,"" the 1968 paper sought to center African culture in the study of literature and education generally, and to set up the department of African Literature and Language in place of English departments. The trio's quarrel was that despite African countries getting independence from the West, the former colonizers were still entrenching imperialism through English texts and post-colonial education systems. The paper was not well received by the former colonizers and their agents. Unsurprisingly, the group was accused of advocating for ""cultural and racial purity"" in academia. Nonetheless, that paper was foundational in the teaching of literature on the continent and remains instructional to date.</p>
<p>With that background, it was not a shock to come across a 1976 article in the <em>Times Literary Supplement </em>by D.A.N. Jones thatquestioned Lo Liyong's intellect for editing and writing a hard-hitting foreword for Ham Mukasa's book, <em>Sir Apolo Kagwa Discovers Britain</em>. It is about a visit by Sir Apolo Kagwa (then prime minister of Buganda Kingdom)to the United Kingdomfor the 1902 coronation of Edward VII.</p>
<p>In his article, titled ""Through a gloss darkly,"" Jones wrote:</p>
<p>The author, Ham Mukasa, is reporting a conversation between his companion, Sir Apolo Kagwa and ""five of the judges of Glasgow."" These five men asked Sir Apolo many questions, such as: ""Are there many drunkards in your land?"" Later, reports Mukasa, these judges asked: ""Do you have drunkards in your Parliament?"" Sir Apolo replied: ""A drunken man cannot come into our Parliament."" Mukasa goes on ""They were very pleased at hearing that drunkards were not allowed in our Parliament, and that the Parliament itself did not like there being drunken men in our country; and told us how they themselves imprisoned drunkards for two or three days...</p>
<p>Being the no-holds-barred writer that he is, Lo Liyong seemed to have thought that interaction spoke of the prejudice the British held against their former colony, Uganda. Why didn't they, for instance, ask how people in Buganda Kingdom viewed their political and economic future? Lo Liyong's foreword alluded to that incident in not very polite words, underscoring the fact that mighty Britain had flaws too, but that it wouldn't admit it to their colonial subjects.</p>
<p>Jones quotes Lo Liyong's excerpt thus:</p>
<p>Europeans in Africa masquerade as Gods, they act in a stylised manner and want to look larger than life. You can only see them for the ordinary humans they are when you see them in their natural habitat....In Edinburgh, the Mayor asked Sir Apolo what he did with drunken councillors. To Sir Apolo, the idea of a drunken councillor was preposterous. He said: ""We simply don't have drunkards in our council....""</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Lo Liyong, mixing up the two cities—Edinburg and Glasgow—was not going to earn him any marks. Jones wrote: ""One looks for the relevant section. Chapter 9 is entitled ""Glasgow City Councillors are Drunkards"". This may be true, for all I know, or may have been true in 1902. But Edinburg is not Glasgow.""For this‘literary crime' Jones opens the book review with a damning declaration: ""There is such an air of unreliability about the product that one hesitates to pass on any of the information it offers.""</p>
<p>Jones had a problem with Lo Liyong's diction in the foreword, something the reviewer believes can cause an insurrection. He was not impressed with Lo Liyong's argument that the life of the common man cannot be glamourized ""unless you are a fool."" The common man, according to Lo Liyong ""needs leadership. And his intellectual betters, his technologized betters, have to supply these to him."" Throughout the foreword, Lo Liyong agitates for young Africans to be aspirational and to look up to leaders within their midst rather than staying hung up on their white colonizers. This overarching point is, however, skipped over by the book reviewer. Jones writes:</p>
<p>His notes and foreword to<em> Sir Apolo Kagwa Discovers Britain </em>create the impression that he wishes to give schoolmasterly advice to young people in Uganda and encourage them to admire noble Africans who achieved power during Victoria's reign, like Apolo Kagwa and Ham Mukasa. This may well be a worthy aim, but the editor's work will set the children of Uganda no example of accuracy, and his political opinions are the sort that provoke democrats to rebellion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Jones is pleased with Ham Mukasa's writing in the book. He describes Mukasa's voice as ""genuine"" and applauds both Mukasa and Sir Apolo for the ""generous, eloquent Victorian style."" He added, ""There is every indication that he made a good job of it--his African aristocratic values mingling with his biblical knowledge to produce something rather like a Homeric account of feasts and ceremony, turning the jaunt into a little Odyssey.""</p>
<p>Despite the praise, Jones still dubsthe book a ""muddle"" and ""a mess."" He believes ""Heinemann made a serious mistake in giving Lo Liyong lo Liyong this book to edit,"" a mistake that makes one feels ""a total distrust for the whole product.""</p>
<p>Jones' dismay at Lo Liyong's inaccurate reference to a UK city is understandable. For a continent that has borne the brunt of inaccurate, biased, and outright unfair representation by outsiders, Africans know how not getting it right can cause damage. However, Jones' criticism of Lo Liyong and his rubbishing of the book seems based on a bias that he cannot admit.</p>
<p>While Jones is upfront in writing off Mukasa's book, <em>The Sunday Times</em> writer David Williams has a different approach. His tone is ripe with mockery as he calls Mukasa and his narrative subject Sir Apolo ""agreeable, intelligent men [who] are lost in wonder, love and praise at what they see.""</p>
<p>Williams draws this conclusion after quoting a line from the book in which Mukasa writes: ""The Canal is a marvellous thing, and shows how the Europeans can always do what they set about doing."" As they traveled to Britain, Mukasa and Sir Apolo marveled at Suez Canal, the Egyptian sea-level waterway that connects Africa, Asia, and Europe. Opened just 33 years before their sojourn to Britain, Mukasa and Sir Apolo must have been genuinely impressed by the man-made infrastructure. It's unclear if David's sarcasm stemmed from a belief that the canal is a developmental given, and that any admiration of its greatness can only emerge from impressionable Africans.</p>
<p>Williams's February 15<sup>th</sup> 1979 review calls <em>Sir Apolo Kagwa Discovers Britain</em> a ""naïve"" version of Charles de Secondat's <em>Persian Letters</em> in which the writer recounts the experiences of two Persian noblemen traveling through France. Where Secondat's satirical work has a ""deep sophistication"" Mukasa's book is considered ""effective in its artlessness.""</p>
<p>That Williams's review is titled ""Innocents abroad,"" also illustrates perception of the two Buganda royals as clueless less-thans. He writes that ""The British nannie-knows-best type of brainwashing has done a good job on them.""</p>
<p>The book editor, Lo Liyong, doesn't escape the knife in Williams's review too. His foreword and notes are believed fit ""primarily for African readers."" His arguments are considered ""not new"" but delivered with ""buoyancy""—a flattery that could as well be regarded as an insult. While Jones thought Mukasa's book deserves no recommendation, Williams prescribes it as ""a refreshing and sobering read for ex-imperialists."" Even that, one wouldn't take it as a compliment. Lo Liyong's unapologetic manner of writing was never going to get him far in the books of the people he criticizes.</p>
<p>In fact, in a September 18<sup>th</sup> 1970 article in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>, its nameless writer advises the poet to tone down his rhetoric. Reviewing Lo Liyong's book, <em>The Last Word</em>, a compilation of literary criticisms about ""African authors and the philosophy of Negritude,"" the author notes that ""There is the same tireless search for what will (it is hoped) shock or offend, the same refusal to lower the voice and speak quietly and confidently to the reader."" The article concludes that ""If Mr Lo Liyong will both cool and sharpen his wit, he may yet learn to cut deep.""</p>
<p>Such a conclusion demonstrates the attacks often aimed at subversive African writers: the casting of doubt on their work and questioning their intellect without engaging substantially with their creativity or the issues that they raise.</p>

"recqnPXiEcTEkHg03","apdp.commentary.000017","Advocacy and Representation in Chinweizu's ""The Detention of Jack Mapanje"" in The Times Literary Supplement","<p>When Malawian writer Jack Mapanje published his first book <em>Of Chameleons and Gods</em> in 1987, he found himself in great opposition to the government at the time, which banned his book and arrested him. The poetry collection critiques the system of lies and corruption in Malawi's government, especially critiques the president at the time, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Mapanje's arrest was not hidden from global attention and in January 1988, Chinweizu Ibekwe covered the story for <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>. His article, ""The Detention ofJack Mapanje,"" deals with the protest that ensued in Grosvenor Square as people appealed for his release and also delves deep into the poet's political activism as well as the international advocacy that grew following his arrest. Chinweizu provides context for the gathering and includes a rather striking detail: even at the protest, people read from Mapanje's banned book—a gesture that echoes the political underpinning of the poet's work and highlights the power of poems in confronting the repressive regime in the country.</p>
<p>Throughout the news article, Chinweizu describes Mapanje as a ‘Malawi poet' and uses his doctorate title (Mapanje received his PhD in linguistics from University College London). The reporter acknowledges Mapanje's honors, including serving as one of the judges for the Commonwealth Poetry Prize in both 1985 and 1986. Although seemingly trivial, the recognition of Mapanje as a poet and doctor bears much significance. First, there is some conditioning and framing taking place as one reads the story; these labels indirectly point toMapanje's work and position or favorable status in the society, which no doubt shapes how one chooses to approach the article, and secondly, Chinweizu simply gives honor where it is due. The unfortunate news of Mapanje's detention does not, in any way, reduce the value of his work, discredit his academic standing, nor take away from the power of his message. Mapanje's message and intention, according to an interview with The Guardian in 2007 was to ""survive, and you will embarrass the dictator with your life. Die and give up, then he has triumphed. Victory for you is first, survival. Second, if you have the opportunity, tell your story."" And indeed, it is a story he tells with a cultivated consciousness and hope in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>It is very likely that his choices of how to frame the story are influenced by Chinweizu's awareness of and engagement with African literature and critique of Western imperialism which argues for a decolonized African text. In writing about Chinweizu in 2021, Tunji Olaopa of <em>The Guardian Nigeria News</em> observes that the journalist was at the forefront of the ""ideological act of redefinition and reclamation"" of African literature and literary criticism. Chinweizu's commitment to the welfare and responsibilities of writers is easily reflected in his treatment of the subject at hand.</p>
<p>In the news article, Chinweizu does not merely cover the protest but also considers the injustice at play. His writing takes the report a step further by questioning the validity of the cause of detainment and he also studies Mapanje's arrest in the context of similar past cases. In his account, Chinweizu notes the speculation surrounding the arrest of the ""forty-three year old poet and lecturer and how ""it may all have to do with how politicians…may have interpreted Mapanje's poems which could be seen as critical of government policies."" In revealing this detail, he continues to frame Mapanje as a political poet, one whose work interrogated the governing administration and advocated for marginalized groups. More specific toMapanje's writing style was also the focus on chameleon politics—the deceptive conformity or alliance to a political party where people avoid expressing their private political opinions and switch from one party to another. Chinweizu's piece reflects a well-informed and empowering portrayal of the poet, and his article attempts to have a balanced report on a matter of such gravity.</p>
<p>On the history of the Malawi government in silencing writers, Chinweizu writes: ""African rulers normally ban books which frighten them when they first appear…Anything remotely individual is, by definition, potentially subversive."" This sentiment is echoed by Mapanje himself, who, in his 2000 interview in Cork Review said, ""In those years, anybody who thought independently became a rebel."" Again, it is reflected in the introduction to his book, <em>Of Chameleons and Gods</em>, where Mapanje writes: ""The verse in this volume spans some ten turbulent years in which I have been attempting to find a voice or voices as a way of preserving some sanity. Obviously, where personal voices are too easily muffled, this is a difficult task…"" By situating the poet within the oppressive structures of destructive leadership, there is a real attempt by Chinweizu to identify and address the cause for Mapanje's arrest and detention. Chinweizu seems to be saying that the poet is not the problem; the political nature of his work is also not the problem, but rather Mapanje's insistence to speak out in a nation that disregards human rights and exercises power in arbitrary ways.</p>
<p>The article ends with a rallying and encouraging plea to support Mapanje's release, including a call to PEN and Index on Censorship, two groups that campaigned for Mapanje's release. Chinweizu's article features people like Somali writer Nuruddin Farah and Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o–and other prominent African writers whose voices would play a critical role in raising awareness and rallying support. It is interesting to note that Farah also experienced threats from the Somali government for the publication of his novel <em>A Naked Needle</em>. Similarly, Thiong'o's novel <em>Petals of Blood</em> led him to be detained for its political message. Given the familiar experiences of these writers with Mapanje's situation, it almost makes them the most suitable and effective choice to be highlighted in the article—an opportunity Chinweizu does not miss. Not only does this gesture highlight the global concern Mapanje's arrest caused, but it also demonstrates a unifying sense among African who champion the freedom of expression and educates the public on the unjust silencing of writers.</p>
<p>Chinweizu presents a statement of hope for a change, and he does this by addressing the reader directly as if to drive home the point: ""anyone with doubts about the practical effectiveness of individual letters of protest might be reassured by the testament of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o…"" Chinweizu's personal advocacy and care for the subject at hand stands out here. His coverage is articulated with a firm assertion of the unjust nature of the poet's detention, the necessary political and historical context for readers to understand the significance of the incident, as well as a commending representation of the poet Jack Mapanje and the revolutionary and rallying power of his work.</p>

"recememBkW8sv6ciG","apdp.commentary.000018","Kofi Awoonor: The Unsung Poet From Ghana","<p>Dr Kofi Awoonor (1935-2013) was born Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor-Williams and was christened George. He studied in Ghana, England, and the United States. He was a poet, novelist, playwright, and critical essayist. Awoonor's published poetry collections include, but are not limited to: <em>The Latin American and Caribbean Notebook</em>(1992),<em> The House by the Sea</em>(1978), <em>Ride Me, Memory</em>(1973), <em>Night of My Blood</em>(1971), <em>Until the Morning After</em>(1987), and <em>Rediscovery and Other Poems</em>(1964). His other creative works include <em>Comes the Voyager at Last</em>(1992) and <em>This Earth, My Brother</em>(1971). His critical non-fiction works include <em>The African Predicament: Collected Essays</em>(2006), <em>Ghana: A Political History from Pre-European to Modern Times</em>(1990), and <em>The Breast of the Earth: A Survey of the History, Culture, and Literature of Africa South of the Sahara</em>(1975).</p>
<p>Between 1972 and 1976, Kofi Awoonor was featured four consecutive times in <em>The Times</em> newspaper and <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>, and in each mention, he was cited as a ""Ghanaian poet."" Yet, the only time his work was reviewed was when his newly published novel <em>This </em><em>E</em><em>arth My Brother</em>... was the text of focus. None of his earlier poems were ever given a review in <em>The Times</em>.</p>
<p>The March 1972 <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> review describes Kofi Awoonor as ""a learned Ghanaian poet with an evident gift for narrative (when he chooses to exercise it), and he ought to be a good novelist..."". The review proceeds to indicate that parts of his novel contain ""short sketches about his growing up in west Africa, which we would be pleased to find in magazines"". The review adds that the text includes the ""misprinted Latin exhortation (for ""pleban,"" read ""plebam""). The <em>Times</em> reviewer further adds that several of the chapters are written with ""contemptuous obscurantism,"" ""banal generalisations,"" ""pompous allusiveness,"" and ""a worked out hysterical morbidity."" The reviewer concludes that ""there is no doubt that Kofi Awoonor could write a very good novel.""</p>
<p>Any reviewer of literary texts backs their analysis with textual evidence. <em>The Times Literary</em> reviewer attempts only on one occasion to show textual evidence by quoting the so-called ‘misprinted Latin exhortation' in Awoonor's <em>This Earth,</em><em> My Brother</em>. That attempt is commendable; however, has the reviewer ever heard of poetic licence and play on words? Or should one presume that he deliberately closed his mind to such a possibility in Awoonor's work? To describe someone's text as full of ""contemptuous obscurantism,"" ""banal generalisations,"" ""pompous allusiveness,"" and ""worked out hysterical morbidity"" without any textual evidence and then to make a sudden U-turn and declare that Awoonor could be a good novelist, the operative word being ""could,"" is very problematic. How could a review made up of derogatory epithets end up meeting the house style of one of the world's most renowned newspapers and get published? But it is no surprise that this critic is continuing Western critics' indiscriminate review of African work.</p>
<p><em>The Times</em> was generous enough to turn its focus on Kofi Awoonor on three other occasions, 26<sup>th</sup> of August 1976, 9<sup>th</sup> of October1976, and 28<sup>th</sup> of October 1976. The August 1976 news item report indicated that Ghana had cancelled a visa issued to magistrate Sir Osmond Williams, a British citizen, who was to serve as a witness in the trial of Ghanaian poet Dr Kofi Awoonor. Awoonor was on trial for sheltering Brigadier Kojo Kattah as the latter faced treason charges for an attempted coup d'état.</p>
<p>The October 9<sup>th</sup> news item, titled ""Verdict on Ghanaian Poet,"" reported in part that a judgement would be given on October 29<sup>th</sup>. It was added that Dr Kofi Awoonor had denied ever granting shelter to Brigadier Kojo Kattah, a man suspected of having a hand in the abortive coup d'état that attempted to overthrow General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong's Supreme Military Council (S.M.C.) government.</p>
<p> Finally, the October 28<sup>th</sup> issue of <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> carried a story captioned ""Ghana Military Grants Pardon to Jailed Poet."" This report on Kofi Awoonor indicated that ""a Ghanaian poet and lecturer"" was ""convicted and sent to prison a year on the charge of aiding the escape of Brigadier Alphonse Kattah, who was alleged to have instigated an abortive coup last year"" (that is 1975). In 1975, Kofi Awoonor returned to Ghana and began teaching as a lecturer at the University of Cape Coast for many years before moving on to teach at the University of Ghana, Legon. </p>
<p>Indeed, 1976 was a challenging year for Kofi Awoonor as his life was on the line because the military was on high alert, arresting and executing individuals presumed to be plotting against the military government of Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, the sixth head of state of Ghana (1972-1978). This state of emergency notwithstanding, Awoonor was repeatedly featured not as any ordinary Ghanaian individual but as a ""Ghanaian learned poet"" by <em>The Times</em>. This esteemed title marked him off for greater scrutiny, yet, the news reporter did not find it prudent to mention in passing or comment on any of the works that earned Awoonor that unique identity. Readers of the issue who might have had their first-hand knowledge of Kofi Awoonor on reading this article might be asking themselves: who is this poet? What are his poems like? Coming events, they say, cast their shadows; could the 1972 <em>Times</em> review of <em>This</em> <em>Earth</em><em> My Brother</em> have any relationship with the cruel absence of any focus on Awoonor's poetry? Could it be the case that his poems were deemed not ‘fit enough to be given a mention'? One could only surmise because the silence on Awoonor's poems is too loud to be ignored.</p>
