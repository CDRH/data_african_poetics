Brutus was the centre of a diplomatic incident last September after he was shot down in a busy Johannesburg street by a police warrant officer as he made a dash for freedom. Brutus was banned and confined to the magisterial area of Johannesburg last year after his return from Europe where he had made representations about discrimination in Olympic teams. He broke his ban and went to Swaziland from where he intended to return to Europe to approach Olympic headquarters in Switzerland, but after crossing the border into Mozambique he was arrested by Portuguese secret police and returned to South Africa. Brutus said at the time and repeated in court today, while pleading in mitigation of sentence, that he had had a valid Rhodesian Federation passport. During the diplomatic row at that time Pretoria submitted that Brutus was a South African citizen. The magistrate ruled that Brutus's contention that his escape bid was made to draw attention to his situation was not altogether valid, but the court would take into account that he had been wounded, which was a partial penalty for his offence.

B. Yeats and Ezra Pound was confined to the literary fringe of revoution, and only the poets of the Irish and Spanish Republics, Patrick Pearse, and Garcia Lorca, seem fit to be considered in the same breath as Goethe and Byron. Last week's Insight story on running illicit arms to Nigeria (""Gun-running via Birminham"") has, however, produced a contemporary contender for the role, a distinguished Nigerian poet, Christopher Okigbo. Okigbo, a member of the beleagured Ibo tribe from Eastern Nigeria, planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1,007 sub-machine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria. After a short stay in Geneva, where the negotiations with Favier took place, Okigbo flew to Rotterdam shortly before an ancient DC 4 took off on its ill-fated flight. Indeed, he was due to travel with the aircraft, but fortuitously changed his mind at the last moment. When the aircraft crashed in Cameroun just north of the Nigerian border two days later, a suitcase and some books belonging to Okigbo were found among the wreckage. CLASSICAL SCHOLAR. Born in 1932, Okigbo was educated at the Ibadan University where he was a classical scholar. After graduation, he became private secretary to the Nigerian Minister of Research and Information, but two years later he left to teach, and eventually represented the Cambridge University Press in West Africa. His poetry, as yet, shows no signs of political commitment. Although in one of his T. S. Eliot-inspired works the refrain reads: ""& the mortor is not yet dry...""; it refers, prosaically, to construction material not weapons of war. But Okigbo has during the last month gathered the raw material for what could, if he writes it, be the first epic poem about an illicit arms deal.""

Bowra. The article, ""Africa on Record"", focused on the importance of oral literature in societies where there are no means of recording, in writing, the compositions that constitute such people's literature. It lamented the scant attention paid to oral literature in Africa at that period and mentioned that what was available was gathered by missionaries, officials, and travelers, and that even those materials were left in the hands of private enterprise. The authors maintained that the best way to understand Africa properly was to do so from the inside, through the oral productions of its people. In the necessary urgency to do that, the authors traced such efforts that had made useful contribution in this direction. Such efforts included the Oxford University Press that published the first four volumes of ""The Oxford Library of African Literature"". This according to the authors had helped preserve habits and memories derived from much earlier times. The authors also mentioned other works of value such as ""The Heroic Recitations of the Bahima of Ankole"" written by Henry F. Morris and ""Somali Poetry: An Introduction"" by W.H. Whiteley. They also mentioned how literary production continued in different forms with people like J.E. Caseley Hayford, T. Mofolo. B. Diop, until it got to others such as the Nigerian poet, Gabriel Okara.

P. Clark, Christopher Okigbo--who made their debuts in the late Fifties and early Sixties. For these writers, examined in detail in Bruce King's Introduction to Nigerian Literature, a consciousness of their own cultural dilemma proved not an inhibition but a spur. Unlike Tutuola, whose imaginatively translated Yoruba foklore owes its richness as much to mistranslation of Yoruba as to a feeling for the adopted language itself, they are constantly aware of their responsibilites... Those who have picked the clearest path are without doubt the Ibo novelist Chinua Achebe and the Yoruba playwright Wole Soyinka. Soyinka is a poet, in love with words, images and myths, whose plays blend in a unique mixture all the rich formal elements of European drama with the haunting complexities of African ritual. The accomodation here between teh two cultures is complete. Gerald Moore's Wole Soyinka is a useful introduction for the student, but of course there is no substitute for reading or, if possible, seeing Soyinka's marvellous plays...""","","","","[""art"", ""language"", ""culture"", ""Yoruba"", ""folklore"", ""drama""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recp1nQrGF2t2FVcK', 'rec7nHVQbDT6XKQF2', 'recVV3HuNvZVOJBwo', 'recfp55t9W6WJ8eBm', 'recUvp3AixDWz2HkM', 'recJ8n8v5kyrzRbW7', 'rec1aVXiu3G1Vvohm', 'recCqsQ3GVsiwhSFv', 'recftKxGM1BVC6Z1i', 'recGJNXDjCsusyRyN', 'recCmBvH4nlkxaHyP', 'recoV2mLZuWv4B5Ev', 'rec4WDiuQEc55ANrH', 'recn1KjU5xJ7W2F9b']","Publish","""[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.itn.000265)|Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.itn.001150)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.

The first special number of The Times Literary Supplement on this theme clearly anticipated some such answer and there are many reasons why one might be tempted to give it... There are two spurs which are likely to gaod the non-European writer more and more in the direction of experiment in the coming years. First, the sense of alienation which is apt to pursue him everywhere once he becomes fully aware, in the search for an identity, of what he is not... Secondly, those who are attempting to record in English or in French the lives of people who do not spak them are immediately confronted with the absolute necessity to experiment with langauge. They may attempt to transfer the imagery, the speech-rhythms, or even, as Gabriel Okara of Nigeria has done in one interesting chapter, the actual syntax of vernacular speech. Whatever they do, they cannot evade the problem, for language taken straight from the European novel or stage will ring falser than any experiment...""","","","","[""language""]"," - ","","['rec3tU2DyxuE0Qwem', 'rec9MgPIUTdYcChNH', 'recBC6Alxwf34wOtV', 'recpuXpVhnbuPxEFG', 'rec0GGeYoARdj4Thn', 'recBcQclyaCexX78X', 'recqZsuGcrsHgYcKR', 'reccGSXW4us1Ta4I5', 'rec6rv2l1i9sZgfQ1', 'recb6ncGgjQfTZBdn', 'rec0riY56oBV8vTSa', 'recahZOGh1iTqhuiZ']","Publish","""[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.itn.000399)|Poet;;;[Breton, André]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Césaire, Aimé]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Moore, Gerald]()|Critic;;;[Moore, Gerald]()|Article Author;;;[Baudelaire, Charles]()|Writer;;;[Bergman, Ernst Ingmar]()|Writer;;;[Ray, Satyajit]()|Writer;;;[Nkosi, Lewis]()|Writer;;;[Fugard, Athol]()|Writer;;;[Williams, Denis]()|Writer;;;[Lamming, George]()|Poet;;;[Modisane, William 'Bloke']()|Writer""","[""Okara, Gabriel""]","[""Moore, Gerald""]","1960","","","","[""apdp.publication.000001""]",""

If a book is written in English or French then it is seen as a by-product or subdivision of the Great Tradition, of Modernism, or of some other beautified cultural monolith... They defend African orature against its alleged deficiencies in characterization and range of expression, and witheringly expose the pretensions of European critics who half get the point and so miss it by miles--in, for example, comparing the brevity of many African novels with oral tales... Toward the Decolonization of African Literature is not a pioneer study but it articulates a point of view which is increasingly heard among African critics and which has not previously been marshalled with so much damning quotation. It restores to literary criticism a brio, verging at times on insult, which is rare in Western criticism, where so often genteel irony or theoretical contortions are substituted for plain-spoken assertion of a fully held point of view.

The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which includes 36 countries in its membership has cabled the British Government stating that African countries will withdraw from the Edinburgh games in protest at what they regard as racism in cricket. Mr. Denis Brutus, the chairman of Sanroc, said in London last night: ""At a recent meeting of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which was held in Cairo our representatives had never seen such militancy expressed on the question of the visit of the South African cricketers. We in Sanroc are now proposing to cable all member countries of the Commonwealth Games Federation asking them to boycott the games. The latest development in the controversy over the cricket tour indicates to us that many very prominent people in Britain are giving their support to the M.C.C. We feel so strongly about this blatant racism that we regretfully have to fight back,"" he said. The chairman of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa is Mr. Abraham Ordia, a member of the Nigerian National Olympic Committee and the secretary is Mr. Jean-Claude Ganga from Brazzaville. It was, at first, the Kenyan Minister for Sport who suggested that no sportsman from his country would run in Edinburgh against anyone who had competed in the all-white South African games last year. He has been given the full support of black Africa and it is felt that Asian and West Indian members of the Commonwealth will soon follow suit. Mr. Brutus said: ""I hope that even at this late date it is not too late for a change of mind in Britain. But the most recent developments suggest the South Africans will still play here with far-reaching effects upon international sport.""

They constitute virtually the entire oeuvre of black South African fiction writers, essayists and some poets, including Lewis Nkosi, Ezekiel Mphahlele, and Denis Brutus, and such individual works by myself, Dan Jacobson, Jack Cope, Mary Benson, C.

In some cases, exile has nurtured creativity, giving writers the political space to reveal the disparity between official rhetoric and reality. But to many it has not been kind... Okot P'Bitek, the Ugandan poet, is not the only one who, lacking a connection to the society he longed to write about, drank himself to death... In some instances, though, the elaborate repressive apparatus of the state has stimulated creativity by compelling writers to develop subtle and imaginative ways of bypassing censorship. Jack Mapanje, Malwai's best-known poet, who was released in May last year after three-and-a-half years' detention without charge or trial, believes that the draconian measures taken by the Malawi Censorship Board may have inadvertently caused him to write better poems.

LAST ""MINSTREL"" OF NORTH AFRICA
FROM OUR ALGIERS CORRESPONDENT

Just after noon on January 12, almost at the beginning of Ramadan the famous Moslem poet Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi, died at Mazuna.  He was over 80, and had been il for a long time. For may years he lived at Ain-Morane, where he was the central figure in a group of native chiefs, the descendants of those who had fought in the border battles btween Bu-Maaza, the Sultan of the Dahra and the Warsenis, and Saint-Arnaud and Pelissier. He was the living history of those stirring times.
Later on he came to Mazuna and became the proprietor of a Moorish cafe, which was opened by M.Jules Cambon, then Governor-General of Algeria, and was for many years a place  of pilgrimage for poets from all over North Africa. His chief delight was in long improvisations, for which he relied on his remarkable retentive memory. In his library were to be found nearly all the works of the North African Moslem poets especialy those of Morocco and Western Algeria, and he would readily recite long narrative poems of over 1,200 lines, such as the famous Moslem poems of the seventeenth century. He died poor, having spent nearly all his money in paying scribes to record the traditional Moslem poetry. Wirh him has passed probably the last of those who have long borne the banner of Moslem ministrelsy in North Africa.","","['rec5QTXygRJUaGBBm']","""[Death of Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi](apdp.event.000074)""","[""death"", ""religion""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['reciZ9FOYexhqW60D']","Publish","""[El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda](apdp.person.itn.000213)|Poet""","[""El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda""]","","1930","","","","[""apdp.publication.000005""]",""

Significantly, not one griot or towncrier from the oral tradition had been invited; not one representative of African literatures in African langauges participated. Many participants criticized the Eurocentrism of the Nobel theme. While Gabriel Okara (a Nigerian novelist and poet of the generation which began to publish at the time of independence in the early 1960s) saw the Nobel award as a 'recognition of African literature in the global context'. Zulu Sofola, a Nigerian playwright of the next generation, viewed it with reservations: 'If the award was given to Soyinka as a ticket to enable us to enter into the club of Western writers, then it is not useful to us.' A third interpretation was offered by William Conton, a novelist from Sierra Leone, who thought of it as 'a recognition of an African writer, who writes according to the concept of literary excellence of a group of Europeans.' In his address to the Conference, the Nigerian president, Ibrahim Babangida, stressed the need to preserve African literature in native language as the use of foreign languages tends, he said, to obscure the character of these works. G. G. Darah of Nigeria, citing the example of his researches into the oral literature of the Urhobo, declared that the corpus of the African spoken tradition is vaster than that of Europhone literature, and that its preoccupations are more relevant to the majority of Africans today; the Nigerian poet and polemicist, Chinweizu, argued that the Nobel was irrelevant to African culture: Europhone African literature--barely a century old--should take second place to Afrophone African literature, which is at least 5,000 years old. Eurocentrics attempted to curb the tide of Afrocentrism with vague pleas for cultural 'universalism'; or with claims that a return of the sources of African civilization would be 'naive romanticism' but at the end of the five-day conerence it was clear that the indigenous agenda had won. A resolution honouring Cheikh Anta Diop, whose studies in Egyptology recovered for African heritage the achievements of the Egypt of the pharoahs, was moved from the floor and added to the official communique.""","","","","[""afrophone"", ""language"", ""indigenous""]"," - ","","['recStcR6ZHRKibLoC', 'recR9mJyrrPTX8aYh', 'reciDPicErQfAqmIH', 'recDSoYkvP2wmlnZA', 'rec9dUElrUn0nd0tC', 'recpyGfdYTZ0ZdHOI', 'rec579GvsOmBCzUUb', 'recEBtyVdtfQMfpvW']","Publish","""[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.itn.000399)|Poet;;;[Ibekwe, Chinweizu](apdp.person.itn.000218)|Poet;;;[Sofala, Zulu]()|Writer;;;[Babangida, Ibrahim]()|Politician;;;[Darah, G.

The first successor to Lawino, Okot's Song of Ocol, was a disappointment, for it savoured too much of a conscientious attempt to give a voice to an essentially dull, pompous, and vindictive husband. But it was interesting to trace Okot's influence in the work of another Acoli writer, Okello Oculi, whose Orphan offered some passages of real bitterness and power...The impact of the second song is weakened by a slight sentimentalizing of the all-knowing, all-suffering harlot; yet here too Okot uses his new poetic language to induce the reader's sympathy to flow into strange places and to illuminate the corners of hidden lives.

Sir--You published a report in the Diary some time ago (May 16) that I had received a letter from Wole Soyinka. This letter contained one very disturbing paragraph which at the specific request of the Nigerians who had sent the letter on to me I could not immediately make public. Now I can. This paragraph reads: ""Physically not as good as may be expected. Serious eye complaint, no treatment. More than a year asking for treatment--ignored."" Last year in a letter dated August 23 Chief Awolowo wrote to me ""With reference to your letter dated July 11, 1968, I am reliably informed that Mr. Wole Soyika is alive and in good health."" It must be obvious that if Wole's letter to me was accurate then Chief Awolowo was seriously misinformed. In the gaols of the world many political prisoners languish, some in appalling conditions denied all contact with the outsside world, others tortured, humiliated, and forgotten. Protests from outside sometimes make these conditions harsher and it is often difficult to know when to speak and when to keep silent. To plead for compassion and understanding, to ask that the political prisoners in Nigeria should be treated with humanity, is not to take sides in the horrible conflict that is tearing the country apart. A country is judged ultimately by the humanity that it shows in such instances and in its adherence to civilized standards. I am not interested nor are others in getting special treatment for Wole Soyinka. We are interested in trying to ensure that he and others like him should be treated with compassion....","","['rec6EUGd5CWwAC6WP']","""[Arrest of Wole Soyinka in August 1967](apdp.event.000044)""","[""solitary"", ""imprisonment""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recS7idXJ1qAm5u18', 'reccP6kF0r6tAxDtR', 'recdPLp4HdDN6Asuy']","Publish","""[Collings, Rex]()|Reporter;;;[Awolowo, Obafemi]()|Politician;;;[Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'](apdp.person.itn.000930)|Poet""","[""Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'""]","","1960","","","","[""apdp.publication.000005""]",""

A further point to note about the Ibo group of writers is that although their ethnic origins are Ibo, their experience was often national and before the political crisis so was much of their writing...""","","","","[""language"", ""global"", ""painting"", ""war"", ""nigeria"", ""literary""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['rectpByOwliYCS8ae', 'recfh0X21Gzx3OtrC', 'recflYuXNb8tmarLE', 'recTkO6dBXoCZZOwz', 'recE4kLMsb1PJ7r2v', 'recb1WuIJBbdocyNM', 'recNLcsYtbgKQBoit', 'recYYmaJuQuHCAqQR', 'recbNJAJtUcRcjFPP', 'recsdEkmQIoZeskBX', 'recDTRdznaRqtZFlJ', 'recSE36bxXUqTAphu', 'recj9PR4tPiCorpO9', 'rec4cV1sIRWjMJIwE', 'rec6FaTHl4Jua4tSG', 'rec0fjAZdkg1dCVgP', 'reclsiWDGYrZjodmP']","Publish","""[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.itn.000399)|Mentioned Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.itn.001150)|Mentioned Poet;;;[Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'](apdp.person.itn.000930)|Writer;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.itn.000265)|Author;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.itn.000265)|Poet;;;[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.itn.000399)|Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.itn.001150)|Poet;;;[Cash, James Allan]()|Reporter;;;[Obo, Peter]()|Artist;;;[Pike, Douglas]()|Reporter;;;[Ekwensi, Cyprian]()|Writer;;;[Armah, Ayi Kwei]()|Writer;;;[Hutchinson, Alfred]()|Writer;;;[Deutsch, André]()|Writer;;;[Nwapa, Flora]()|Writer;;;[Nwankwo, Nkem]()|Writer;;;[Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'](apdp.person.itn.000930)|Poet""","[""Okara, Gabriel"", ""Okigbo, Christopher"", ""Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'"", ""Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'"", ""Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'"", ""Okara, Gabriel"", ""Okigbo, Christopher"", ""Soyinka , Wole 'Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde'""]","","1970","","","","[""apdp.publication.000005""]",""

Even works which seem to honour African history with some straightforwardness, like Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958), have hinted at interior weaknesses in the local personality which have been forewarnings of dissensions to come in the heyday of colonialism and of corruptions after independence... Ten years ago people argued whether Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter could be considered an African novel. Now they battle over the aesthetic criteria for evaluating literature which does not need to look to Europe for its legitimacy.

Perhaps that is why both Mr. Donatus Nwoga's paper on the short story and Mr. Mphahlele's own on the novel consisted largely of lengthy quotations from a handful of writers. Even Mr. Ulli Beier, of Ibadan, who is the outstanding critic in this field, confined himself virutally to the writings of the Nigerians Christopher Okigbo and J. P.

Harry Blamires, in his introduction to A Guide to Twentieth Century Literature in English, discloses that he and his two fellow compilers have been free with their opinions, in the belief, it seems, that an unopinionated guide might put readers to sleep. Yet a book like this, encyclopedic in form, is more likely to be consulted than read, and it might be felt that utility rather than readability ought to have been teh primary concern...As the survey approaches the present, its drawing o the literary map--at least of the British one--becomes very crude indeed. A. N. Wilson is in, but not William Boyd, Malcom Bradmury is there but not David Lodge... Is Okot p'Bitek Uganda's sole literary contender?

The enterprise is undoubtedly worth while: our world is certainly not politically a single world, but culturally it is becoming at least potentially so. In literature, as in music and the visual arts, we feel a need to have some knowledge by report of what we may never know by acquaintance... In the African section of the fourth volume, the late Christopher Okigbo is credited with being 'one of the most exciting poets now writing in Africa,' and some critics might feel that the formative Western influence was Pound rather than Eliot. The poet from Gambia described as 'Leurie Peters' should surely be Lenrie Peters. It is pleasant to find that very fine bilingual writer in Afrikaans and English, Uys Krige, dealt with briefly,  but with proper respect, as is the highly civilized and persecuted South African poet, Dennis Brutus. The note on the Nigerian dramatist Wole Soyinka mentions that his most famous play, The Lion and the Jewel, 'presents the impositions of modern civilization as a threat to the African villagers' individuality.' ...""

Mr. Kiplig replied, ""It's a case of there's Pringle, and there's Pringle, and there's a lot of good verse, light and half-light, but scattered, and there are the poems in the Taal, part translations and parodies, part original.""
Pringle was the son of a Scotch Border farmer, roughly contemporary with Keats. He acquired a good literary position in Edingurgh and made the friendship of Scott. But literature did not pay, and in 1819 he went out to South African with a Scotch party. He spent some time with them in the bush and then attempted a new iterary career in Cape Town, but quarrelled with the governor, and returning to England threw himsef into the cause of the abolition of slavery. Just when success was reached he died at the early age of 46 in 1834.","","","","[""slavery"", ""death""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['rec6lTXOj7fjQJeCP', 'recKa2rY3X9Ivcj9K']","Publish","""[Kipling, Rudyard]()|Poet;;;[Pringle, Thomas](apdp.person.itn.000168)|Mentioned Poet""","[""Pringle, Thomas""]","","1910","""[Jeni Couzyn: Her Poetry and Motherhood](apdp.commentary.000012)""","","","[""apdp.publication.000005""]",""

Since his elevation in retirement to the Academie Francaise in 1983 and his move to Paris, the turmoil of his continent's political fortunes have so dimmed this renown that reappraisals of his writing now seem overdue. Melvin Dixon's English rendition of the definitive body of his poetry will, it is to be hoped, encourage this process."" Mason traces the history of the negritude movement and Senghor's involvement. She also criticizes some of the translation by Melvin Dixon, but ultimately praises the collection: ""Thus, while inadvertent infelicities occasionally muffle the poetry's African voice, nevertheless Melvin Dixon achieves that rarest of feats in the translation of poetry: he recreates Leopold Senghor in our own tongue, exhibiting with unflagging good faith his universality as a poet of love, of nature, of war and, rarest of modern accomplishments, of praise.","""[The Collected Poetry (1998)](apdp.work.000067)""","","","[""negritude"", ""language"", ""identity""]"," - ","","['recQPBNz0amPgy1kM', 'recjcuVyJVrX1OzzG', 'rec4ykFbnI5fAtckl', 'recj5qwi9z58xQHKR', 'recHY5FVSdbMMYw1l', 'recUscQLZHrAIlccB', 'recgFEuUN5JaFRFtp', 'recgPUUzywCrX9stB', 'reczGEMJJpurHUsEe']","Publish","""[Senghor, Léopold Sédar](apdp.person.itn.001141)|Poet;;;[Whitman, Walt]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Césaire, Aimé]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Mackay, Claude]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Maran, René]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Diop, Alioune]()|Mentioned Poet;;;[Mason, Sheila]()|Critic;;;[Mason, Sheila]()|Article Author;;;[Dixon, Melvin]()|Academic;;;[Pompidou, Georges]()|Politician""","[""Senghor, Léopold Sédar""]","[""Mason, Sheila""]","2000","","","","[""apdp.publication.000001""]",""

Wole Soyinka is known in Nigeria and in Britain not only as a dramatic writer, but also as an actor and producer. His earlier play, The Road, a highlight of the Commonwealth Arts Festival last year, recently won the Drama Prize at the Negro Arts Festival in Dakar. The Trials of Brother Jero is a satirical comedy, featuring a cunning prophet (played by Zaikes Mokae), whose brand of Christianity works to his own advantage. The Strong Breed is about a savage New Year ritual and the search for a scapegoat.

I was, of course, most fortunate in gaining admission to a government college, one of those rare schools which the colonial administration built and endowed lavishly, for obscure reasons of its own. Cricket was played zealously and, in one of them at least, Eton Fives. But their most valuable asset was books.

This quality is unfortunately lacking in Anthony Graham-White's 'The Drama of Black Africa.' ... One important point that all three books tend to obscure (for instance, through book lists giving dates of publication rather than composition) is that the flow of dramatic writings of high literary quality in English has dried to a trickle in the past decade.

Its American editor-in-chief, Mrs. Rosalie Murphy, says she ran into many problems. In Nigeria, the questionnaire sent to Wole Soyinka was not passed on to him in prison, where he has been for two years; while the entry on Christopher Okigbo had to be dropped after Mrs. Murphy had confirmed a report that he had been killed in the civil war. Then there were many black South African poets who have escaped from or otherwise left the country and still move from place to place: Bloke Modisane, believed to have left South Africa on foot in 1950, was traced to London. Minor racial complications occurred in this country, too. Most poets from Wales put down ""Welsh"" as their nationality, although some admitted to ""Anglo-Welsh."" Most Scots preferred ""British,"" while some northern Irish put ""British-Irish."" In America, nearly all Negroes called themselves ""Black,"" although LeRoi Jones added exotically ""African-American-Ancient Egyptian.""

This was a seminar organised by the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid and held in Havana, attended by 200 delegates including the crucial nucleus of leading African sports officials and SAN-ROC. It was at this stage that Dennis Brutus, the president of SAN-ROC, a professor of English in the African Studies Department at the Northwest University of Illinois, threw his own acknowledged ability and experience and that of SAN-ROC unequivocally behind the African protest. Brutus, an exiled coloured South African, who was imprisoned in South Africa as a result of his views on apartheid, was portrayed in oarts of the British and foreign Press last week as a somewhat sinister figure.

Mr. Okot's poem was originally composed in Lwo, the language of the Acoli people. Much of its imagery is rooted in their traditional songs of love, war, victory, and death. In rewriting his poem in English he has chosen a strong, simple idiom which preserves the sharpness and frankness of this imagery, a structure of short, free verses which flow swiftly and easily, and an uncondescending offer of all that is local and specific in the original... Inevitably lost is the pattern of rhyme, assonance and tonal variation offered by the vernacular. In the poet's own words, he has 'clipped a bit of the eagle's wings'.

Mostly this is attributed to the fact that the French built far fewer schools than the British, but provided a thorough secondary education. At the same time it was their avowed policy to assimilate Africans to French culture. Since they claimed that West Africa was not really a colony but ""France Outre-Mer"", Africans were considered as underprivileged only as long as they did not have a French education... On the other hand Nigeria made a very late start. There was nothing at all before Mr. Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard, which was published in 1952. Even then it took years before literature in Nigeria got off the ground. But the past few years have seen a literary activity here that equals anything in French West Africa. There are at least four novelists of interest: Achebe, Ekwensi, Nzekwu and Babatunde Jones (the last unpublished); there are lively poets: Okara, Soyinka, Clark and Okigbo--the first two represented on the previous page. There are the playwrights: Soyinka, Clark, Yetunde Esan. The place is full of literary criticism and controversy; there are literary journals, clubs and associations."" ...","","","","[""territory"", ""racism"", ""pidgin"", ""language""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recqjcBKmDpxS5Odo', 'recRSrVDTEwaeDOqq', 'rec4I5JGhh2fr9Qxg', 'recU62rHmV0b6Ue8q', 'recdIOABbMesTlStz', 'recbiaZ0y8IGuks7M', 'recrJXtdxx4LsKbgI', 'recwje3d2but5YzxJ', 'recHVfCy8QRY4vZRe', 'recYiON7LVVR22Not', 'rec3OuhQ1pqKbeDlc', 'recX83TGXwQZygceO', 'recIeeYnh83lUt1uV', 'recE5YkqDivU7OXtl', 'recA5BsoeP8l7ku8M', 'recMwuSTviYCFK5N5', 'recupSZN2qyMIUX3G']","Publish","""[Senghor, Léopold Sédar](apdp.person.itn.001141)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.itn.000265)|Poet;;;[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.itn.000399)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.
