Pringle was the son of a Scotch Border farmer, roughly contemporary with Keats. He acquired a good literary position in Edingurgh and made the friendship of Scott.

LAST ""MINSTREL"" OF NORTH AFRICA
FROM OUR ALGIERS CORRESPONDENT

Just after noon on January 12, almost at the beginning of Ramadan the famous Moslem poet Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi, died at Mazuna.  He was over 80, and had been il for a long time. For may years he lived at Ain-Morane, where he was the central figure in a group of native chiefs, the descendants of those who had fought in the border battles btween Bu-Maaza, the Sultan of the Dahra and the Warsenis, and Saint-Arnaud and Pelissier. He was the living history of those stirring times.
Later on he came to Mazuna and became the proprietor of a Moorish cafe, which was opened by M.Jules Cambon, then Governor-General of Algeria, and was for many years a place  of pilgrimage for poets from all over North Africa. His chief delight was in long improvisations, for which he relied on his remarkable retentive memory. In his library were to be found nearly all the works of the North African Moslem poets especialy those of Morocco and Western Algeria, and he would readily recite long narrative poems of over 1,200 lines, such as the famous Moslem poems of the seventeenth century. He died poor, having spent nearly all his money in paying scribes to record the traditional Moslem poetry. Wirh him has passed probably the last of those who have long borne the banner of Moslem ministrelsy in North Africa.","","['recEXq1UMGV0DVDuc']","[Death of Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi](apdp.event.000074)","[""death"", ""muslim"", ""minstrel"", ""ramadan"", ""pilgrimage""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recR6GJau3JnTb8Tt']","True","[El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda](apdp.person.000213)|Poet","[""El Hadj Belarbi, Sheik Benguedda""]","","1930",""

Walder writes, ""As Nkosi applies this distinction, the remarkably rich and varied literary manifestations of the continent do begin to fall into a kind of order. And its application enables the critic to proceed to the level of insight which relates the different uses of, for example, traditional Malagasy folk poetry - the so-called hain-teny or proverb formula - by the poets concerned, to their respective personal and class positions: Rabearivelo, the 'deracinated' intellectual whose reworking of the hain-teny conceits read like translation; and Ranaivo, the rediscoverer of his own culture who integrates the hain-teny into his work, thus bringing together 'task' and 'mask'.""

Sir--You published a report in the Diary some time ago (May 16) that I had received a letter from Wole Soyinka. This letter contained one very disturbing paragraph which at the specific request of the Nigerians who had sent the letter on to me I could not immediately make public. Now I can. This paragraph reads: ""Physically not as good as may be expected. Serious eye complaint, no treatment. More than a year asking for treatment--ignored."" Last year in a letter dated August 23 Chief Awolowo wrote to me ""With reference to your letter dated July 11, 1968, I am reliably informed that Mr. Wole Soyika is alive and in good health."" It must be obvious that if Wole's letter to me was accurate then Chief Awolowo was seriously misinformed. In the gaols of the world many political prisoners languish, some in appalling conditions denied all contact with the outsside world, others tortured, humiliated, and forgotten. Protests from outside sometimes make these conditions harsher and it is often difficult to know when to speak and when to keep silent. To plead for compassion and understanding, to ask that the political prisoners in Nigeria should be treated with humanity, is not to take sides in the horrible conflict that is tearing the country apart. A country is judged ultimately by the humanity that it shows in such instances and in its adherence to civilized standards. I am not interested nor are others in getting special treatment for Wole Soyinka. We are interested in trying to ensure that he and others like him should be treated with compassion....","","['recFLrKzBr8C3R8PF']","[Arrest of Wole Soyinka in August 1967](apdp.event.000044)","[""illness"", ""arrest"", ""solitary"", ""imprisonment"", ""jail""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recOC8yZFlntopk7T', 'recrePhjfQCGPkwUY', 'recLWDo1wgiz3MFmH']","True","[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Collings, Rex]()|Reporter;;;[Awolowo, Obafemi]()|Politician","[""Soyinka, Wole""]","","1960",""

Okot P'Bitek, the Ugandan poet, is not the only one who, lacking a connection to the society he longed to write about, drank himself to death... In some instances, though, the elaborate repressive apparatus of the state has stimulated creativity by compelling writers to develop subtle and imaginative ways of bypassing censorship. Jack Mapanje, Malwai's best-known poet, who was released in May last year after three-and-a-half years' detention without charge or trial, believes that the draconian measures taken by the Malawi Censorship Board may have inadvertently caused him to write better poems.

The main accusation levelled here is that European critics have attempted to annex African literature for themselves. If a book is written in English or French then it is seen as a by-product or subdivision of the Great Tradition, of Modernism, or of some other beautified cultural monolith... They defend African orature against its alleged deficiencies in characterization and range of expression, and witheringly expose the pretensions of European critics who half get the point and so miss it by miles--in, for example, comparing the brevity of many African novels with oral tales... Toward the Decolonization of African Literature is not a pioneer study but it articulates a point of view which is increasingly heard among African critics and which has not previously been marshalled with so much damning quotation. It restores to literary criticism a brio, verging at times on insult, which is rare in Western criticism, where so often genteel irony or theoretical contortions are substituted for plain-spoken assertion of a fully held point of view. Also, the book is fundamentally right...""","","","","[""decolonization"", ""colonialism"", ""westernization"", ""criticism"", ""review""]"," - ","","['recATJOKsxVI6yflO', 'reciEjXHawmE0AT4Z', 'recHtgMbpBpNm1vjL', 'recraGRP2XGMquNb2', 'rec1BJYs9KUXbeZCU', 'recIYRDicrWjthzmt', 'recdI3wXnJpZwPSJp', 'recU7M7JE47G78DAp', 'recaxRhHXbEBMcde7', 'recM6DdxrAwmzHoT7', 'recmcIVoAQMN9gc9H', 'recNkGiXxbadZ6J35', 'reczXWTyOFidqOkzz', 'recESJnh0JfFvCihN', 'recEvrraR6aZcbsSb', 'rechK0fGTk9suWdka', 'recWapQ9eW48UmxYr', 'recNczSxXtuUANmIw', 'recHKS11suktFgc94', 'recPHe4cn7BbcaeKT', 'recgaUrQDaeWdsOla', 'recAuxZgVMq4hd55U', 'rec3n1wdwifYphW76', 'recO5mLVf9z9shbSX', 'recAUEJCTkhJpDmiy', 'recCUstQMCyR6siN2', 'recijDGxW8nztQMFa', 'recYE7LOqiFI0kWV6']","True","[Senghor, Léopold Sédar](apdp.person.001141)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.000265)|Poet;;;[P'Bitek, Okot](apdp.person.001284)|Poet;;;[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Mentioned Poet;;;[Niven, Alastair]()|Critic;;;[Niven, Alastair]()|Article Author;;;[Ibekwe, Chinweizu](apdp.person.000218)|Writer;;;[Jemie, Onwuchekwa]()|Writer;;;[Madubuike, Ihechukwu]()|Writer;;;[Cabral, Amílcar Lopes da Costa]()|Writer;;;[Fanon, Frantz Omar 'Ibrahim']()|Writer;;;[James, Cyril Lionel Robert 'C.

Opiche, Osotsi), Ugandans (Okot P'Bitek, Peter Nazareth), and a Somali (Abdi Sheik-Abdi).

The first successor to Lawino, Okot's Song of Ocol, was a disappointment, for it savoured too much of a conscientious attempt to give a voice to an essentially dull, pompous, and vindictive husband. But it was interesting to trace Okot's influence in the work of another Acoli writer, Okello Oculi, whose Orphan offered some passages of real bitterness and power...The impact of the second song is weakened by a slight sentimentalizing of the all-knowing, all-suffering harlot; yet here too Okot uses his new poetic language to induce the reader's sympathy to flow into strange places and to illuminate the corners of hidden lives.

Brutus was banned and confined to the magisterial area of Johannesburg last year after his return from Europe where he had made representations about discrimination in Olympic teams. He broke his ban and went to Swaziland from where he intended to return to Europe to approach Olympic headquarters in Switzerland, but after crossing the border into Mozambique he was arrested by Portuguese secret police and returned to South Africa. Brutus said at the time and repeated in court today, while pleading in mitigation of sentence, that he had had a valid Rhodesian Federation passport. During the diplomatic row at that time Pretoria submitted that Brutus was a South African citizen. The magistrate ruled that Brutus's contention that his escape bid was made to draw attention to his situation was not altogether valid, but the court would take into account that he had been wounded, which was a partial penalty for his offence.

Significantly, not one griot or towncrier from the oral tradition had been invited; not one representative of African literatures in African langauges participated. Many participants criticized the Eurocentrism of the Nobel theme. While Gabriel Okara (a Nigerian novelist and poet of the generation which began to publish at the time of independence in the early 1960s) saw the Nobel award as a 'recognition of African literature in the global context'. Zulu Sofola, a Nigerian playwright of the next generation, viewed it with reservations: 'If the award was given to Soyinka as a ticket to enable us to enter into the club of Western writers, then it is not useful to us.' A third interpretation was offered by William Conton, a novelist from Sierra Leone, who thought of it as 'a recognition of an African writer, who writes according to the concept of literary excellence of a group of Europeans.' In his address to the Conference, the Nigerian president, Ibrahim Babangida, stressed the need to preserve African literature in native language as the use of foreign languages tends, he said, to obscure the character of these works. G. G. Darah of Nigeria, citing the example of his researches into the oral literature of the Urhobo, declared that the corpus of the African spoken tradition is vaster than that of Europhone literature, and that its preoccupations are more relevant to the majority of Africans today; the Nigerian poet and polemicist, Chinweizu, argued that the Nobel was irrelevant to African culture: Europhone African literature--barely a century old--should take second place to Afrophone African literature, which is at least 5,000 years old. Eurocentrics attempted to curb the tide of Afrocentrism with vague pleas for cultural 'universalism'; or with claims that a return of the sources of African civilization would be 'naive romanticism' but at the end of the five-day conerence it was clear that the indigenous agenda had won. A resolution honouring Cheikh Anta Diop, whose studies in Egyptology recovered for African heritage the achievements of the Egypt of the pharoahs, was moved from the floor and added to the official communique.""","","","","[""literature"", ""afrophone"", ""criticism"", ""language"", ""native"", ""indigenous"", ""foreign"", ""oral"", ""orature"", ""griot"", ""towncrier"", ""tradition""]"," - ","","['recrAJVsvw3QLqNhs', 'recvF1Yyo4ENRkUEn', 'recqgTNUXg1ZqncR7', 'recRKmmyag2l3FoBx', 'reccZV2G1EeCPApSq', 'recIkrIHXJz6Qs2ms', 'recYFdjzuIb6ssJHy', 'recEeGKRYDyH5OWN1']","True","[Okara, Gabriel](apdp.person.000399)|Poet;;;[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Ibekwe, Chinweizu](apdp.person.000218)|Poet;;;[Sofala, Zulu]()|Writer;;;[Babangida, Ibrahim]()|Politician;;;[Darah, G.

There are two spurs which are likely to gaod the non-European writer more and more in the direction of experiment in the coming years. First, the sense of alienation which is apt to pursue him everywhere once he becomes fully aware, in the search for an identity, of what he is not... Secondly, those who are attempting to record in English or in French the lives of people who do not spak them are immediately confronted with the absolute necessity to experiment with langauge. They may attempt to transfer the imagery, the speech-rhythms, or even, as Gabriel Okara of Nigeria has done in one interesting chapter, the actual syntax of vernacular speech.

They were concerned mostly with one or other of the many external examinations of London University or the City and Guilds... When I was a boy things were rather different. Books were rare indeed. I remember the very strong impression made on me by the rows and rows of books in my school library when I first got there in 1944. I was, of course, most fortunate in gaining admission to a government college, one of those rare schools which the colonial administration built and endowed lavishly, for obscure reasons of its own. Cricket was played zealously and, in one of them at least, Eton Fives. But their most valuable asset was books. It is no doubt significant that, besides myself, almost all of the first generation of Nigerian writers had gone to one of the four or five government colleges; T. M.

Mostly this is attributed to the fact that the French built far fewer schools than the British, but provided a thorough secondary education. At the same time it was their avowed policy to assimilate Africans to French culture. Since they claimed that West Africa was not really a colony but ""France Outre-Mer"", Africans were considered as underprivileged only as long as they did not have a French education... On the other hand Nigeria made a very late start. There was nothing at all before Mr. Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard, which was published in 1952. Even then it took years before literature in Nigeria got off the ground. But the past few years have seen a literary activity here that equals anything in French West Africa. There are at least four novelists of interest: Achebe, Ekwensi, Nzekwu and Babatunde Jones (the last unpublished); there are lively poets: Okara, Soyinka, Clark and Okigbo--the first two represented on the previous page. There are the playwrights: Soyinka, Clark, Yetunde Esan.

Perhaps that is why both Mr. Donatus Nwoga's paper on the short story and Mr. Mphahlele's own on the novel consisted largely of lengthy quotations from a handful of writers. Even Mr. Ulli Beier, of Ibadan, who is the outstanding critic in this field, confined himself virutally to the writings of the Nigerians Christopher Okigbo and J. P. Clark and the South African poet Dennis Brutus, saying that he had not seen more than six or seven poems by such other promising writers as Wole Soyinka and Gabriel Okara.

Fifty-three Brigade, to which he had attached himself in a dramatic act of solidarity, was in full retreat, with the exception of Okigbo himself, who had decided to hold his ground in an ill-protected bunker. When the enemy arrived, he tried to lob a grenade at a tank. His body was never found. His memory, though, haunts African writing...

The enterprise is undoubtedly worth while: our world is certainly not politically a single world, but culturally it is becoming at least potentially so. In literature, as in music and the visual arts, we feel a need to have some knowledge by report of what we may never know by acquaintance... In the African section of the fourth volume, the late Christopher Okigbo is credited with being 'one of the most exciting poets now writing in Africa,' and some critics might feel that the formative Western influence was Pound rather than Eliot. The poet from Gambia described as 'Leurie Peters' should surely be Lenrie Peters. It is pleasant to find that very fine bilingual writer in Afrikaans and English, Uys Krige, dealt with briefly,  but with proper respect, as is the highly civilized and persecuted South African poet, Dennis Brutus. The note on the Nigerian dramatist Wole Soyinka mentions that his most famous play, The Lion and the Jewel, 'presents the impositions of modern civilization as a threat to the African villagers' individuality.' ...""

In Chinua Achebe's profound novels comes the most skilful handling of the theme: the bridging of time between village and city, all illuminated with a variety of tone, a subtlety of speech, which is only now being recognized, and which needed the critical understanding of John Pepper Clark, the Nigerian dramatist, to make the social nuances of its characters clear to the non-African reader...""","","","","[""city"", ""village"", ""tone"", ""death"", ""drum"", ""mask"", ""murder"", ""war"", ""despair""]"," - ","","['reciD42bv2urdjssM', 'recemSsaJ1omrQGa6', 'recke48XnUvzwBgxg', 'rechdgiAMaoZJHfxR', 'recrtiNAcQIJEFgUu', 'recnV1lnTt8VFKtGB', 'recFz8VFXtD2xXRZF', 'recUPA4Xy0am5vnOP', 'reclFc500PFp9mqVl', 'recxOtU4nqKhlhuSw', 'recYN5OBVU5I32lAp', 'recO2VIxtES6RS1no', 'recK4AyVEL3RR3hdk', 'recETyRSQMGeijZOt', 'recW5DLPCpMgelXPL', 'recTdoe3nfYUuV5xX']","True","[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.001150)|Poet;;;[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.000265)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.

B. Yeats and Ezra Pound was confined to the literary fringe of revoution, and only the poets of the Irish and Spanish Republics, Patrick Pearse, and Garcia Lorca, seem fit to be considered in the same breath as Goethe and Byron. Last week's Insight story on running illicit arms to Nigeria (""Gun-running via Birminham"") has, however, produced a contemporary contender for the role, a distinguished Nigerian poet, Christopher Okigbo. Okigbo, a member of the beleagured Ibo tribe from Eastern Nigeria, planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1,007 sub-machine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria. After a short stay in Geneva, where the negotiations with Favier took place, Okigbo flew to Rotterdam shortly before an ancient DC 4 took off on its ill-fated flight. Indeed, he was due to travel with the aircraft, but fortuitously changed his mind at the last moment. When the aircraft crashed in Cameroun just north of the Nigerian border two days later, a suitcase and some books belonging to Okigbo were found among the wreckage. CLASSICAL SCHOLAR. Born in 1932, Okigbo was educated at the Ibadan University where he was a classical scholar. After graduation, he became private secretary to the Nigerian Minister of Research and Information, but two years later he left to teach, and eventually represented the Cambridge University Press in West Africa. His poetry, as yet, shows no signs of political commitment. Although in one of his T. S. Eliot-inspired works the refrain reads: ""& the mortor is not yet dry...""; it refers, prosaically, to construction material not weapons of war. But Okigbo has during the last month gathered the raw material for what could, if he writes it, be the first epic poem about an illicit arms deal.""

Many of their authors will not have faced the question which their unique position asks them; of those that have, a surprising number will turn out to belong to that amazing generation of Nigerians--it includes Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, J. P. Clark, Christopher Okigbo--who made their debuts in the late Fifties and early Sixties. For these writers, examined in detail in Bruce King's Introduction to Nigerian Literature, a consciousness of their own cultural dilemma proved not an inhibition but a spur. Unlike Tutuola, whose imaginatively translated Yoruba foklore owes its richness as much to mistranslation of Yoruba as to a feeling for the adopted language itself, they are constantly aware of their responsibilites... Those who have picked the clearest path are without doubt the Ibo novelist Chinua Achebe and the Yoruba playwright Wole Soyinka. Soyinka is a poet, in love with words, images and myths, whose plays blend in a unique mixture all the rich formal elements of European drama with the haunting complexities of African ritual. The accomodation here between teh two cultures is complete. Gerald Moore's Wole Soyinka is a useful introduction for the student, but of course there is no substitute for reading or, if possible, seeing Soyinka's marvellous plays...""","","","","[""audience"", ""art"", ""sculpture"", ""language"", ""culture"", ""Yoruba"", ""folklore"", ""drama""]"," - ","© Times Newspapers Limited.","['recRF9c2exzAv4PlP', 'recY8UUNcuezvUX5A', 'recGueZcHs5cqZSyS', 'recu2ALQjkb1hYDpe', 'recOwC9PFLi2cnguc', 'rectCW7WOmP22hJdC', 'recifUcRB9Kx26dPX', 'recAhs1E0SS7oKqac', 'recbxZUpcKEoZwUyl', 'recOAhB2iQN15l1U8', 'recfQk1ZPrEAVNTrD', 'recbt8z3Acxq0pJrF', 'recX2zq7vj8BxQ7xl', 'recD3amQmtobyPPkx']","True","[Soyinka, Wole](apdp.person.001220)|Poet;;;[Achebe, Chinua 'Albert Chinualumogu'](apdp.person.000265)|Poet;;;[Okigbo, Christopher](apdp.person.001150)|Poet;;;[Clark, John Pepper 'J.

Excerpt: ""I was in Harare to attend this year's Zimbabwe International Book Fair, the fifteenth, and, unsurprisingly, a shadow of some recent ones - not so much in numbers but in vitality. Known as Africa's largest book event, the annual fair suffered a significant falling off rate because of the legitimate fears of international visitors (including Africans from other parts of the continent), many of whom made their decision to attend at the last minute or to skip this year entirely... Still, this year's Book Fair ('Celebrating African Books') left one extraordinary mark on the continent itself, as well as on the international literary world. Few major writers made it to the fair, though many were asked. Ghana was the 'focus' country, but even Ghana's most esteemed writers (Kofi Awoonor, Ayi Kwei Armah and Ama Ata Aidoo), announced in pre-Book Fair press releases, did not show up...""","","['recVW0TZAK8zp6wSQ', 'rec8DDTzckzOd9J5N']","[Zimbabwe International Book Fair](apdp.event.000057);;;[Zimbabwe Economic Crisis](apdp.event.000058)","[""international"", ""event"", ""economy"", ""crisis"", ""recession"", ""inflation"", ""independence""]"," - ","","['rec6oUJt2YvPiIgLr', 'reciRuCnTmlNcth4K', 'recsYdSGuLITkikCn', 'recs9QPEDmg6w7wvq', 'recaA5TCivUUURbEU', 'rec9XbaooJfwtZ0Pg', 'recsglNAT0bim6a5u', 'recACNWmMH5TCrT7L', 'reczsNvYGKYusgjyj', 'rect6LNtBUNQWpnh0', 'reclLQ6CW9rJUukMB', 'recnGYYQkfPOWykXL', 'rec6l2MbWdymln1PA', 'recLUpZBFxXKj2YIw', 'rec6s4VNDVL6PJsQM', 'recJAC8GSVBQ8UuLN', 'recUL6FyxDegSkUyj', 'recSCgVKLvZA6Lvis', 'recAUC7w8yAVOauqM', 'recB0ykMHLKuQ0Vf5']","True","[Larson, Charles R.]()|Critic;;;[Larson, Charles R.]()|Article Author;;;[Mugabe, Robert Gabriel]()|Politician;;;[Tsvangirai, Morgan]()|Politician;;;[Awoonor-Williams, George Kofi Nyidevu 'Kofi Awoonor'](apdp.person.001046)|Poet;;;[Armah, Ayi Kwei]()|Writer;;;[Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'](apdp.person.000708)|Poet;;;[Hove, Chenjerai](apdp.person.000284)|Poet;;;[Mungoshi, Charles]()|Writer;;;[Mungoshi, David](apdp.person.000840)|Poet;;;[Vera, Yvonne]()|Writer;;;[Chinodya, Shimmer]()|Writer;;;[Caine, Michael]()|Academic;;;[Okri, Ben](apdp.person.000331)|Poet;;;[Tadjo, Véronique]()|Writer;;;[Boyd, William]()|Writer;;;[Ribeiro, Alvaro]()|Writer;;;[Aboulela, Leila]()|Writer;;;[Kilalea, Rory 'Murungu']()|Writer;;;[Waberi, Abdourahman](apdp.person.001253)|Poet;;;[Staunton, Irene]()|Publisher","[""Awoonor-Williams, George Kofi Nyidevu 'Kofi Awoonor'"", ""Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'"", ""Hove, Chenjerai"", ""Mungoshi, David"", ""Okri, Ben"", ""Waberi, Abdourahman""]","[""Larson, Charles R.""]","2000",""

Extensive quotations from the plays, clearly related to context, and the attractive format of the book, make it a pleasure to read... This quality is unfortunately lacking in Anthony Graham-White's 'The Drama of Black Africa.' ... One important point that all three books tend to obscure (for instance, through book lists giving dates of publication rather than composition) is that the flow of dramatic writings of high literary quality in English has dried to a trickle in the past decade. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly political disillusionment, the ebbing of the powerful romantic and idealistic forces that produced an astonishing flood of creativity in the period just before and just after independence...""","""[African Theatre Today (1976)](apdp.work.000027);;;[The Drama of Black Africa (1974)](apdp.work.000026);;;[African Literature Today (1968)](apdp.work.000025)""","","","[""independence"", ""review"", ""play"", ""playwright"", ""theater"", ""theatre"", ""drama""]"," - ","","['recAeQ0dKvQIA1pdC', 'recXzA3Ijkxh6bdcw', 'rec66qJYTnjt3ugZh', 'recD3ej4VsJFY6UHw', 'recIGINWASIDszsVB', 'rech7CqEVaU0YeLC6', 'rec6kFnuumdtmVagF', 'recQmzDxXjVJ5RBh9', 'recKOSdku7YW78uzQ', 'rec2dHKTh1LS445xk', 'rec6HaYy3jaVa6jlr', 'recPx5szHxHYR2wPS', 'recKBRjHBmiam3Uni', 'recURIejXW0PMiLME', 'reclIeNqhnZrWueHz']","True","[Axworthy, Geoffrey]()|Critic;;;[Axworthy, Geoffrey]()|Article Author;;;[Banham, Martin]()|Editor;;;[Jones, Eldred Durosimi]()|Editor;;;[Aidoo, Ama Ata 'Christina'](apdp.person.000708)|Poet;;;[Ogunde, Hubert]()|Actor;;;[Ladipo, Duro]()|Artist;;;[Ogunmola, Kola]()|Actor;;;[de Graft, Joseph Coleman 'J.
