## African Poetics Contemporary African Poets Database

Data set is a google spreadsheet, must be saved as csv and uploaded to data/csv (file -> download - comma seperated values). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u50HDal2Y_0yuat3GTyihmAnxXe62F16uljKBWzihT8/edit#gid=1063158215

Ask Karin if you do not have permission to spreadsheet/containing folder. 

Theree are currently HTML files not being used, until these are worked into the site run data type CSV

Text for searching featured poets is simply pasted into spreadsheet at this point, will eventually draw from html in source folder

I've gotten a bit creative with schema fields for this project

- people = Alternate Names
- title = Lastname, Firstname
- alternative = Firstname Lastname
- person.role = Gender notation
- keyords = region
