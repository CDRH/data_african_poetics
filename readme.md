## About The African Poetry Digital Portal

The African Poetry Digital Portal is a project of the African Poetry Book Fund. The Portal is a resource for the study of the history of African Poetry providing access to biographical information, artifacts, news, video recording, images and documents related to African poetry from antiquity to the present. It will also feature specially curated digital projects on various aspects of African poetry.

The first two sections of the portal â€” Contemporary African Poets and African Poets and Poetry in the News have been developed with the support of the Ford Foundation and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Current development is supported by the Mellon Foundation.
